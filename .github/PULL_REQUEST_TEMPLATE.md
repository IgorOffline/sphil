### Recommended Steps

1. Ensure your PR is [linked to an issue](https://github.com/systemphil/sphil/issues), or create one if missing. This is to ensure that multiple contributors are not working over each other on the same thing.
2. Review [contributions document for coding](https://github.com/systemphil/sphil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### License Scope

The Apache License 2.0 applies to all code except content within `content/**` folder (excluding `/contributing/**`, `_meta.ts`, `acknowledgements.mdx`, `index.mdx`, `privacy.mdx`, `team.mdx`, `terms.mdx`). This primarily covers technical implementations rather than content, literature, or philosophy.
