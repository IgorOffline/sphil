## Checklist

-   [Â ] Docs contribution (philosophy, literature, content). Leave **unchecked** for <code>code</code> contribution.

    -   [ ]Â **REQUIRED** I accept that my writing is submitted under the [ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), which, briefly put, prohibits commercial re-use of the content, but allows sharing, remixing and building upon the material insofar as attribution is given (see [legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode.en)), and in this regard I understand that my writing is open to be modified, remixed and build upon by others in the sPhil community within the `systemphil/sphil` project in future perpetuity.
    -   [ ]Â **REQUIRED** I have followed the [formatting guidelines](https://github.com/systemphil/sphil/blob/dev/src/pages/contributing/formatting/basic-markdown.md) and verified there are no formatting bugs. [Try markdown preview here](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).
    -   [ ] **REQUIRED** I have followed the [MLA citation style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html).
    -   [ ]Â **REQUIRED** I have added or verified title and description metadata at the very top of the file. Example:

        ```md
        ---
        title: Hegel Guides
        description: Learn about the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel
        ---
        ```

    -   [Â ] My article is a stub or I want to actively encourage contribution, I've added the Stub component to the bottom of my content but _before_ the bibliography:

        ```ts
        import Stub from "@/components/Stub";

        <Stub />;
        ```

    -   [Â ] **REQUIRED** I have added, verified or extended a bibliography. This is added before the authors section and follows MLA guidelines. Example:

        ```mdx
        ## Works Cited

        <div className="text-sm">
            - Hegel, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm. _The Science of Logic_. Translated
            by George di Giovanni, Cambridge University Press, 2010. - Kant,
            Immanuel. _The Critique of Pure Reason_. Edited by Paul Guyer and
            Allen W. Wood, Cambridge University Press, 1998.
        </div>
        ```

    -   [ ] I have signed the document with my name/username under either as `Authors`, `Editors` or `Contributors`.

        > Use **Authors** if you have created and substantially added content.  
        > Use **Editor** if you have made substantial edits or review.  
        > Use **Contributor** if you have made minor edits, reviews or contributions.  
        > If you've done multiple, pick the most weighted: Author > Editor > Contributor.  
        > If you prefer to remain anonymous, that's fine too, but note that a record of your contributions based on your GitHub username will exist here in the codebase.

        ```md
        // Bibliography goes here

        ---

    -   [Â ]Â If the article makes use of footnotes, I have checked that `**Notes**` is exactly the very last item in the file.
