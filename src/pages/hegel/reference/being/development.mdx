## The Development of Being

### Quote

> _Being, pure being_ &ndash; without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly. If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness. &ndash; There is _nothing_ to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact _nothing_, and neither more nor less than nothing (Hegel, 2010, 59/21.68-9).

### Examination

```md
_Being, pure being_ - without further determination.
```

Hegel's _Science of Logic_ begins with a fragment: "_Being, pure being_ &ndash;". `being` is a notoriously difficult category to grasp, and a great part of its difficulty lies in its simplicity. After the first word comes a qualification that this category _must_ be grasped in its purity. Any further specification, or _determination_, loses sight of exactly this purity. While such an attempt to determine being may appear to illuminate some content, it does not illuminate anything about _being_ as such, and will therefore have lost sight exactly the being it meant to say something meaningful about.

```md
In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself
and also not unequal with respect to another;
it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly.
```

The terms equality and inequality here are used to establish difference vis-à-vis being and something else. However, _no difference can_ be established since being is positively not something different from an other. Considered otherwise, there is nothing with respect to being that can be differentiated from it. The thought of `being` in this sense extends in all directions. One might say that everything is being and being is everything, but this view presupposes something that is non-being against which being is differentiated; but this is inadequate, for, as Hegel emphasizes, there is no difference inwardly or _outwardly_. Viewed internally according to its conception then there is _simply_ being.

```md
If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, 
or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, 
it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity.
```

Mention of attempting to generate difference with being, inwardly or outwardly, has already been made. Hegel additionally adds the term `content` here which suggests that the form-content distinction cannot be employed to determine being. Being is not some form that stands over against some non-being content, or, vice-versa, that being is some content that fills out some non-being form.

```md
It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.
```

Paradoxically, the first positive thing said about `being` other than repeating it or its purity, is that it _is_ indeterminate and empty. This is perhaps already transitioning the logic beyond being, since the focus shifts towards indeterminateness and emptiness.

```md
&ndash; There is _nothing_ to be intuited in it, 
if one can speak here of intuiting; 
or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself.
```

The en dash (&ndash;) is often used by Hegel to inline a quick comment. It serves to swiftly elaborate on a logical passage and provide additional guidance. Importantly, in these mini-commentaries, Hegel steps out of the logical development to reflect upon it.Immediately  after the en dash Hegel begins to speak about intuiting and "speaking of" and that does not seem appropriate for a purely logical development. If it is correct that the en dash signals the start of a brief commentary here, then it makes sense why Hegel begins to employ intuition and vague language like "speaking of", since he is now reflecting upon the matter at hand as it has been developed thus far and attempts to help his readers to understand an otherwise extremely abstract idea.

If the en dash does not signal the start of a comment and the logical development still continues, then that invites interpretation as to the precise status of intuition this early in the logic of pure thinking. Discussions on this issue will be provided elsewhere. For the remainder of this development, the en dash is understood to be the start of a comment. 

Intuition is a concept with its own rich history. Spinoza considers it the superior form of knowledge as it basically does everything that intellectual cognition is capable of except it does it immediately.[^1] With intuitive knowledge of a matter, one does not pause to think and piece together various bits in order to arrive at a conception; one simply grasps the conception immediately. For example, one does not need to wait for the pincer maneuver to complete in order to see that one's force is becoming surrounded and cut off from supplies, but instantly recognize the doomed outcome the moment the pincer has been allowed to take shape.

What does intuition signify for Hegel here? Against Spinoza, whose intuitive knowledge seems to always be a determinate conception, intuition does not have any determinate content here. Indeed, intuition appears to actively fail to grasp any determinate matter whatsoever. However, this does not negate that intuition is adequately performing its cognitive function, for as Hegel points out, there really _is_ nothing to be intuited or grasped in pure being.

Lastly, Hegel equates the activity of intuiting pure being with the matter itself. In intuiting that pure being is nothing&mdash;or there is nothing to be intuited in pure being&mdash;the intuiting activity is itself neither more or less than the matter it intuits, namely, pure emptiness.

```md
Just as little is anything to be thought in it, 
or, it is equally only this empty thinking. 
Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact _nothing_, 
and neither more nor less than nothing
```

Hegel continues his comment by reinforcing that no determinate content is to be found in pure being. He once more equates the form of its thinking with the matter. At this zero level of [presuppositionless thinking](/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking), no difference can be established between pure being and its thinking, as that would presuppose a form-content difference _internal_ to the conception of pure being itself. But pure being _cannot be_ that which is separable from the pure thought of it&mdash;pure being does not exist externally to its thought, and certainly not as an entity in the world _apart_ from thought. Indeed, in strictest terms, pure being does not exist, as existence etymologically signals that something stands out, which nominally means that some contrast or determinacy obtains. But no such contrast or determinacy is the case with pure being, and least of all a contrast between pure being and its thinking.

Hegel moves to affirm the emptiness of thinking and establishes that the form is no less than the content (if such distinctions are to be employed), and that as the form is empty and the form is indistinguishable from its content, the content is empty also. Now, this reading employs a syllogistic pattern that distinguishes two elements and establishes a truth based on their union, which appears to be a third element, and one might be tempted to think that that is how Hegel reasons himself to the outcome of the development of being. But the problem here is that these distinctions of form and content, pure being and its thinking, strictly do not exist; that is, they cannot be independently established and so cannot be used in syllogistic reasoning to arrive at the truth. The form-content distinction, along with the matter and its thought, are downstream from the issue and do not serve provide any new information that has not already been given in the conception of pure being. Indeed, the more apt procedure is the one Hegel has already provided, namely, the use of intuition. Intuition is a helpful contrast to syllogistic inference in that where the latter may appear more truthful due to its impressive complexity, it is in fact less since the matter itself cannot be parsed in mediated terms without tampering with its purity. Therefore, intuition with its affinity for _immediate_ cognition, is a more truthful aid in discerning the conception of pure being. 

And so the net result of pure being is that it _is_ simply nothing. No cause or pattern of inference can be employed to establish this result without tautologically repeating it.

## Commentary

### Stephen Houlgate

Stephen Houlgate emphasizes that the start of Hegel's _Logic_ is both a logic and a metaphysics at once. He further points out that the thought of `being` under consideration is not the being _of something_ or the being expressed in the _copula_ of a judgment (e.g. the squirrel _is_ fluffy), "Being is to be understood simply as pure indeterminate being" (Houlgate, 2022, 135).

He further reinforces Hegel's conception of being as utterly indeterminate by contrasting it to Parmenides' conception of being, who understands being in contrast to nothing, as that which is _not_ nothing. This view by Parmenides holds a difference between the two such that being and nothing are kept apart and ossified, neither changing into the other (or indeed any other change for that matter). As Houlgate writes,

>  This is precisely what makes being “changeless”: for, as not-nothing, being neither arises from, nor passes into, nothing. In
Parmenides' words, “it exists without beginning or ceasing”, but, “remaining the same and in the same place, it lies on its own and thus fixed it will remain”. Parmenides goes on to claim that “strong necessity holds it [being] within the bonds of a limit” &ndash; a limit that preserves being as being and keeps it apart from nothing (Houlgate, 2022, 136).

Hegel, in contrast to Parmenides, does not distinguish being from nothing, or essence, things, entities, worlds or anything else for that matter. Any such distinction would render being determinate, and being would not be understood in its utter indeterminacy. 

Moreover, Houlgate points out that `being` is not to be understood in terms of the negation of immediacy ("im-mediacy") or the negation of determinacy ("in-determinate"). This line of thinking would also render `being` something determinate and fail to hold fast to its purity. Instead, `being` must be understood _in_ its immediacy and indeterminate, rather than _as_ immediate and indeterminate. "At the start of logic being must be thought in its utter indeterminacy and immediacy &ndash; and so without being explicitly contrasted with determinacy or mediation &ndash; as pure and simple being" (Houlgate, 2022, 136).

This thinking in terms of _in_ rather than _as_ further helps understand how Hegel's initial fragment concerning `without further determination` is not a defining of `being` _as_ the-being-without-determination, but that of holding `being` _free_ of determination, and to think it in its purity and simplicity (Houlgate, 2022, 136). 

It seen how a non-trivial amount of effort is needed to keep at bay the mind's reflective reflexes, which employ difference, equality, likeness and so forth in understanding a matter. This language of difference with its reflective categories cannot be entirely avoided, but they need not determine the matter, that is, understand `being` in terms of contrasts and mediation. Using negation on these reflective categories, or just careful language, one is able to keep at bay their determination of the matter at hand and allow it to be understood freely on its own terms, which in the case of `being` means its simplicity and purity (Houlgate, 2022, 137). 

A key part of of that simplicity and purity, Houlgate further notes, is that being is not understood in terms of its mediation or as a result of a prior process. One could point to the fact that Hegel's conception of being is the result of presuppositionless thinking and that therefore it must presuppose it, thus showing that `being` is implicitly dependent on an external process which serves to define it and that thinking of it purely according to its own conception is impossible. But Houlgate argues that this omits precisely that `being` as an abstraction must itself also be abstracted, and that this is indeed done in its concept:

> To think of being in this way, we must first abstract from all we ordinarily take being to be; but we must then abstract from, and set aside, the very fact that pure being is the result of abstraction. Only thus will the process of abstraction lead to the thought of being as pure and immediate, rather than as mediated result (or “essence”)(Houlgate, 2022, 138).

In other words, to adequately think pure being is to already have abstracted the fact that it is the result of an abstraction&mdash;the result of a methodical and careful process of presuppositionless thinking. There is nothing _in_ pure being&mdash;internal to its conception&mdash;that suggests or leads one to think that it is the result of a process. Indeed, were that the case, pure being could not itself be nothing. To arrive at the thought of pure being, as it were, is to arrive at the infinite shores of beginning that have no end in sight.
