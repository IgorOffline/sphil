## The Development of Being

### Quote

> _Being, pure being_ &ndash; without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly. If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness. &ndash; There is _nothing_ to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact _nothing_, and neither more nor less than nothing (Hegel, 2010, 59/21.68-9).

### Examination

```
Being, pure being - without further determination.
```

Hegel's _Science of Logic_ begins with a fragment: "_Being, pure being_ &ndash;". `being` is a notoriously difficult category to grasp, and a great part of its difficulty lies in its simplicity. After the first word comes a qualification that this category _must_ be grasped in its purity. Any further specification, or _determination_, loses sight of exactly this purity. While such an attempt to determine being may appear to illuminate some content, it does not illuminate anything about _being_ as such, and will therefore have lost sight about exactly the being it meant to say something meaningful about.

```
In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself
and also not unequal with respect to another;
it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly.
```

The terms equality and inequality here are used to establish difference vis-Ã -vis being and something else. However, _no difference can_ be established since being is positively not something different from an other. Considered otherwise, there is nothing with respect to being that can be differentiated from it. The thought of `being` in this sense extends in all directions. One might say that everything is being and being is everything, but this view presupposes something that is non-being against which being is differentiated; but this is inadequate, for, as Hegel emphasizes, there is no difference inwardly or _outwardly_. Viewed internally according to its conception then there is _simply_ being.

```
If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, 
or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, 
it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity.
```

Mention of attempting to generate difference with being, inwardly or outwardly, has already been made. Hegel additionally adds the term `content` here which suggests that the form-content distinction cannot be employed to determine being. 

```
It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.
```

Paradoxically, the first positive thing said about `being` other than repeating it or its purity, is that it _is_ indeterminate and empty. This is perhaps already transitioning the logic beyond being.
