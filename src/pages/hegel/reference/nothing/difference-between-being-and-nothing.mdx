## The Difference Between Being and Nothing

Following the early logical development of Hegel's _Science of Logic_, pure being and pure nothing are understood to be the same. Each proves to be other yet, equally, both are the same such that there is no distinguishing to be made between them. However, Hegel insists that they are "absolutely distinct" (Hegel 2010, 60/21.70). What is the sense of this distinction?

Typically, one would _determine_ a distinction by developing some quality, property or some other being through which the two are differentiated. However, at the earliest stages of the _Logic_, determinacy itself has not been developed, such that determinacy cannot justifiably be employed to distinguish the two categories. One cannot then make use of some distinguishing factor for an idea that is omnipresent; there is no conceptual space, as it were, where one might draw a border without evoking that space again.

Moreover, determining something that would distinguish `being` from `nothing` also annuls the purity of these terms. If some determinacy were to obtain for either, then they are no longer understood in their purity and the initial meaning of these categories would be lost as well as invalidating their early development. What sense of difference remains then?

### The Immediate Difference Between Pure Being and Pure Nothing

Stephen Houlgate points out that the difference between `being` and `nothing` lies in _intention_ (_Im Meinen_): "There is no clear, determinate difference between the two, but they are nonetheless _meant_ to be different" (Houlgate 2022, 144). He adds that this is not a difference we, as human beings, draw, but belongs to `being` and `nothing` themselves. They are themselves absolutely distinct.

> Pure being does not have any contrast with nothing built into it, but it is pure and simple _being_ without further determination. As such, it is the utter opposite of nothing: it is pure being with no trace of the negative whatsoever. Similarly, nothing has no contrast with being built into it &ndash; and so is not to be understood as "non-being" &ndash; but it is sheer and utter _nothing_. As such, however, it is the complete absence of being (Houlgate 2022, 144).

Notice how each category immediately means something unique to itself yet is _then_ regarded upon reflection in relation to its opposite. But this relation hardly merits the name of a relation since neither category has built into it any form of contrast, whether explicitly or implicitly. Each category simply is.

This simplicity coupled with immediacy sets the difference between `pure being` and `nothing`. "Being and nothing are immediately different because each is purely and immediately _itself_ and thereby completely excludes the other ... each in being itself _in fact_ shuts out the other" (Houlgate 2022, 144). This signals that there is in `pure being` nothing but `pure being`, or, put differently, there is in the thought of `pure being` no conceptual space for anything else&mdash;not even `nothing`&mdash;.

Likewise, as Houlgate goes on to point out, this difference is unsustainable and disappears the moment it is thought. It is merely an _immediate difference_ and so nothing persists beyond this immediacy. Indeed, `being` and `nothing` _vanish_ into each other such that the immediate difference between them is undermined: each is just as indeterminate as the other.

And this indeterminacy envelops also the very difference (does it? or is it wrong to think of it in this way?)
