## The Development of Nothing

### Quote

> _Nothing, pure nothingness_; it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within. &ndash; In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or _nothing_ is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing _is_ (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being. &ndash; Nothing is therefore the same determinations or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure _being_ is (Hegel, 2010, 59/21.68-9).

### Examination

```md
_Nothing, pure nothingness_
```

Similar to [`being`](/hegel/reference/being/development#examination), the account of `nothing` begins with a fragment. The first word states the category in question which is then followed up by a qualifier that this category is to be understood in its purity.

```md
it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, 
complete absence of determination and content; 
lack of all distinction within.
```

Combined with the initial fragment, `nothing` is not to be understood as the absence or lack of something specific, as, for example, "there is nothing in my bank account". Rather, `nothing` _is_ complete emptiness, complete absence of any specificity, matter or existence. Indeed, one can say it is the absence of being. Internally, there is nothing to pick out since no distinction can be made. 

Attempting to grasp it by other means, such as void, will be inadequate since void has a richer and more determinate meaning, such as "this cheque is void". Void specifically points to a determinate existent which is void. This is developed later in Hegel's _Logic_. 

Equally, thinking of `nothing` in terms of negation or negativity is also inadequate, since both terms deal with determinacy and negativity in particular is a term that is profound, nuanced and richly textured.

The idea of `nothing` cannot but be considered through itself&mdash;in "simple equality with itself"&mdash;that is, without reference to anything else. 

```md
- In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and
thinking, it makes a difference whether something or _nothing_
is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has
therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing _is_
(concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is
the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being.
```

Following an en dash along with a change in tone, Hegel goes on to elaborate and reflect through a brief [inline comment](/hegel/reference/being/development#examination) about the development so far. 

If one thinks about `nothing` in terms of intuiting or thinking, that is, as an idea that is being considered by a mind, then immediately a difference emerges between the idea and its thinking. In thinking or intuiting `nothing`, thought or intuition simply are empty, or it is empty thinking or empty intuiting. However, there is nonetheless a difference here since empty thinking (or empty intuiting) is still _thinking_, and that in itself is not empty. 

Hegel goes to add a link between the empty thinking (or empty intuiting) that follows the consideration of `nothing` to be like the empty thinking (or empty intuiting) that follows pure `being`. This may suggest a way in which the transition from one to the other is made, namely, by a syllogism between `being` and `nothing` with "empty thinking" as the middle term. But this goes outside the categories in question and imposes an external assumption of mind. Moreover, it would mean that the transition of `being` into `nothing` is not native to `being` but is some effect of the idea and mind in a particular disposition coming together. The discipline of [presuppositionless thinking](/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking) is long broken and the many assumptions here accrue only more philosophical debt.

Instead, it is better to understand Hegel's passage here to be an aid to the reader that merely reflects on the logic rather than developing it further. This being that the two categories appear to be equally devoid of any meaning, or map on to similar, if not same, manner of thinking. However, the claim that `being` is `nothing` is not on account of empty thinking or any other mental operation no, but purely through its concept. 

```md
- Nothing is therefore the same determination 
or absence of determination, and thus altogether
the same as what pure _being_ is.
```

The final sentence begins with an en dash that may indicate the termination of the inlined comment and a return to the logical development. Further to this is the fact that the passage here has no superfluous material.

It is this on account of the same determination or total lack of determination, which renders `nothing` to be the _same_ as `being`. 

Note that Hegel at this point does not strictly state that pure `nothing` is pure `being`, but only that `nothing ` is _the same as_ `being`. This may still imply that `nothing` is `being` or that one has transitioned into the other, as Hegel goes on to indicate in the next category, but the present text does not state this identification or transition explicitly.

## Further Commentary

### Burbidge

John Burbidge's more psychological reading of the development of the _Logic_ offers helpful guidance in understanding the otherwise very minimal and obscure notion of `nothing`. He begins by stressing that the understanding or cognition that thinks this category has only `pure being` to compare `nothing` with and that it struggles to find any distinguishing identifier: each category is likewise "simply equal with itself", "complete emptiness, absence of all determination and content" and "internally undifferentiated or pure". Yet, some difference must remain, according to Burbidge:

> The only difference that could possible remain is that _being_ represents that feature which _every_ thing has, and which enables it to be thought at all, whereas nothing is _no_ thing (Burbidge, 1981, 39).

Burbidge states next that in the very moment no thing is thought it makes sense to say that one intuits `nothing`. He then claims that by virtue of the deployment of this category _in our thought_ and _applied to our intuitions_, it necessarily "is", in the same sense a unicorn "is" (Burbidge, 1981, 39).

However, when attempting to clarify the matter, the understanding is unable to find any new definitions beyond those found in being and thought moves once again to thinking `being`.

It is not entirely clear how `nothing` is supposed "to be" (or be a case that "is") according to Burbidge without an external reference to thought or intuitions, which are each far much concrete concepts than the simple categories. The attached footnote points to a passage in _The Phenomenology_ from the Miller translation: "...Spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with it. This tarring ith the negative is the magical power that converts it into being" (Burbidge, 1981, 243).[^1] However, this only reinforces the presupposition as the reason why `nothing` turns into `being` is because of an external factor, namely, spirit, rather than something native to the category in question.

[^1]: More context around the passage reads: "Spirit is not this power which, as the positive, avoids looking at the negative, as is the case when we say of something that it is nothing, or that it is false, and then, being done with it, go off on our own way on to something else. No, spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face and lingering with it. This lingering is the magical power that converts it into being. - This power is the same as what in the preceding was called the subject, which, by giving existence to determinateness in its own element, sublates abstract immediacy, or, is only existing immediacy, and, as a result, is itself the true substance, is being, or, is the immediacy which does not have mediation external to itself but is itself this mediation" (Hegel, 2018, 21/ยง32).

{/* TODO note the difference between _is_ (as transition) and _same_ when thinking about being and nothing. former signifies immediate transition whereas latter seems to construe some essence, an "area" where being and nothing are con-joined.  */}
