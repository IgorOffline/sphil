## The Development of Nothing

### Quote

> _Nothing, pure nothingness_; it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within. &ndash; In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or _nothing_ is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing _is_ (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being. &ndash; Nothing is therefore the same determinations or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as what pure _being_ is (Hegel 2010, 59/21.68-9).

### Examination

```md
_Nothing, pure nothingness_
```

Similar to [`being`](/hegel/reference/being/development#examination), the account of `nothing` begins with a fragment. The first word states the category in question which is then followed up by a qualifier that this category is to be understood in its purity.

```md
it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, 
complete absence of determination and content; 
lack of all distinction within.
```

Combined with the initial fragment, `nothing` is not to be understood as the absence or lack of something specific, as, for example, "there is nothing in my bank account". Rather, `nothing` _is_ complete emptiness, complete absence of any specificity, matter or existence. Indeed, one can say it is the absence of being. Internally, there is nothing to pick out since no distinction can be made. 

Attempting to grasp it by other means, such as void, will be inadequate since void has a richer and more determinate meaning, such as "this cheque is void". Void specifically points to a determinate existent which is void. This is developed later in Hegel's _Logic_. 

Equally, thinking of `nothing` in terms of negation or negativity is also inadequate, since both terms deal with determinacy and negativity in particular is a term that is profound, nuanced and richly textured.

The idea of `nothing` cannot but be considered through itself&mdash;in "simple equality with itself"&mdash;that is, without reference to anything else. 

```md
&ndash; In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and
thinking, it makes a difference whether something or _nothing_
is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has
therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing _is_
(concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is
the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being.
```

Following an en dash along with a change in tone, Hegel goes on to elaborate and reflect through a brief [inline comment](/hegel/reference/being/development#examination) about the development so far. 

If one thinks about `nothing` in terms of intuiting or thinking, that is, as an idea that is being considered by a mind, then immediately a difference emerges between the idea and its thinking. In thinking or intuiting `nothing`, thought or intuition simply are empty, or it is empty thinking or empty intuiting. However, there is nonetheless a difference here since empty thinking (or empty intuiting) is still _thinking_, and that in itself is not empty. 

Hegel goes to add a link between the empty thinking (or empty intuiting) that follows the consideration of `nothing` to be like the empty thinking (or empty intuiting) that follows pure `being`. This may suggest a way in which the transition from one to the other is made, namely, by a syllogism between `being` and `nothing` with "empty thinking" as the middle term. But this goes outside the categories in question and imposes an external assumption of mind. Moreover, it would mean that the transition of `being` into `nothing` is not native to `being` but is some effect of the idea and mind in a particular disposition coming together. The discipline of [presuppositionless thinking](/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking) is long broken and the many assumptions here accrue only more philosophical debt.

Instead, it is better to understand Hegel's passage here to be an aid to the reader that merely reflects on the logic rather than developing it further. This being that the two categories appear to be equally devoid of any meaning, or map on to similar, if not same, manner of thinking. However, the claim that `being` is `nothing` is not on account of empty thinking or any other mental operation no, but purely through its concept. 

```md
&ndash; Nothing is therefore the same determination 
or absence of determination, and thus altogether
the same as what pure _being_ is.
```

The final sentence begins with an en dash that may indicate the termination of the inlined comment and a return to the logical development. Further to this is the fact that the passage here has no superfluous material.

It is this on account of the same determination or total lack of determination, which renders `nothing` to be the _same_ as `being`. 

Note that Hegel at this point does not strictly state that pure `nothing` is pure `being`, but only that `nothing ` is _the same as_ `being`. This may imply that `nothing` is `being` or that one has transitioned into the other, as Hegel goes on to indicate in the next category, but the text does not state this identification or transition explicitly.

## Further Commentary

TODO note the difference between _is_ (as transition) and _same_ when thinking about being and nothing. former signifies immediate transition whereas latter seems to construe some essence, an "area" where being and nothing are con-joined.
