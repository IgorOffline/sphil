## Sublation

The importance of the concept of sublation [_Aufhebung_] in Hegel's philosophy
cannot be understated. It is a notion that is virtually omnipresent in Hegel's
entire systematic oeuvre and plays a chief role in the dialectical determination
of ideas and concepts.

However, despite its pivotal significance, it does not receive direct treatment
in _The Science of Logic_, Hegel's major work on logic and metaphysics, apart
from a remark that follows the
[`development of becoming`](/hegel/reference/becoming/development). The remark
in question, however, is instructive given its context and illustrates the
essential three-pronged structure of sublation.

While sublation enjoys common usage in the German language, there is no direct
equivalent in English. And so sublation has become something of a highly
technical term that is most often used in Hegelian scholarship. This is
unfortunate, since the speculative element in the word itself never natively
manifests to the thinker, and one must continuously bring together disparate
meanings into this rather awkward term.

### Semantics

The German _aufheben_ has a twofold meaning, Hegel writes. On the one hand, it
means to _to keep_ or _to preserve_. On the other hand, it means _to cause to
cease_ or _to put an end to_.

But to preserve something, Hegel notes, has a negative tinge to it because to
preserve something one must remove it from its immediacy in order to _retain_
it; and, in so doing, the matter is essentially open to external influences. One
might say that to keep something may mean to hold on to it or secure it, but
thereby losing its innocence. "That which is sublated is thus something at the
same time preserved, something that has lost its immediacy but has not come to
nothing for that" (Hegel 2010, 82/21.94). It can seen already how the meaning of
keeping here cannot but entail negation. This slippage from one idea to the
other is exactly the dialectical thread Hegel puts under the magnifying glass.

Hegel praises words in language that have such double-meanings and notes the
Latin _tollere_, which serves as the root for the English "toll" (payment) and
"extol" (praise). In particular, he notes the deficiency with _tollere_ that its
positive determination only goes as far as "lifting up", whereas _aufheben_
enjoys the additional notion of preserving.

However, Hegel does not directly state the _three_ meanings of sublation, even
though they are all implied in the text.This lack of stating it expressly
appears puzzling given that his own usage relies heavily on it.

### Structure

Sublation in Hegel's philosophy primarily concerns the state of a being. It is a
determinateness that signifies something is no longer immediately what is was,
but is understood as a moment of a context. Despite being something mediated in
this way, it nonetheless contains the the "_determinateness from which it
derives_", which can be understood as a genealogy of its dialectical
development.

In more practical terms, that something is sublated means that it longer retains
the absolute conceptual scope at hand but is relegated to a certain part of it.
However, being in this partial state does not eliminate its initial immediacy
altogether but keeps it precisely as negated. The immediacy _is_ negated, but
the trace back to it is retained.

For example, to say that `being` is sublated in `becoming` means that `being` no
longer is understood in its original immediacy where it held the full scope but
is a moment of the context of `becoming`. The former thus holds a relative scope
and the latter currently holds the absolute scope. Despite holding a relative
scope, `being` nonetheless contains the trace to its original immediacy, and so
we can say that it "points" back to its immediacy. And it can only "point" to
this immediacy because it is exactly unavailable to it (were `being` not
sublated, it would be immediate and there would be no mediation where any
"pointing" would take place).

But why is something sublated? Because a dialectic transition took place where
something no longer is the something it immediately presented itself. Put
differently, the matter at hand is not what it is.

This dialectical transition, however, is not sufficient to understand something
as sublated. `Being` vanishing into `nothing` does not thereby sublate `being`.
To be something sublated, by contrast, entails a binding between its immediate
state and its mediated state. In the context of `existence`, for example, where
`being` and `nothing` are understood to be in a unity, `being` has its immediate
state negated&mdash;there is no `pure being`&mdash;but in being _negated_ it is
no less kept. Sublation thus implies development of a category.

It is this development Hegel refers to when he says that something has become
understood _in its truth_. A category or thought underwent an internal
dialectical transition through which it _turned out to be_ something
else&mdash;not something _completely_ different (the `being` of `existence`
still shares something with `pure being`, its ancestor, so to speak), but also
not something _entirely_ identical.

The new sublated state refers back to its absolute being, and refers to it as
negated, whereby it is simultaneously retained. It is this intense binding that
grants something to be seen _in its truth_: a primordial state that was
internally incoherent whose incoherence reforged it to this current state.

In this way, _truth_, in light of Hegel's thinking, is never something immediate
but the result of a development. It is a context made up of sublated moments,
and whose conception understands that these moments were at one point totally
unbounded, in their boundlessness utterly failed, and found themselves renewed
in this multi-dimensional sphere.

##### TODO

Indeed, `pure being` is rendered, paradoxically, a moment. A moment in the
conceptual evolution of `being` whereby it was initially simple and pure but is
now one among many.
