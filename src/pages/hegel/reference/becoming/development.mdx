## The Development of Becoming

### The Unity of Being and Nothing

#### Examination

The development of `becoming` picks up on the discovery made with the categories
[`being`](/hegel/reference/being/development) and
[`nothing`](/hegel/reference/nothing/development), namely, that `being` and
`nothing` have no distinguishing factor. As discussed
[elsewhere](/hegel/reference/nothing/difference-between-being-and-nothing),
there is a difference between `being` and `nothing` but it is only an
_immediate_ difference.

Hegel begins by pointing out that neither `being` nor `nothing` are stable
categories that simply exist, but that they each pass over into the other. The
truth of the matter is, then, that there is no such thing as `pure being`
_simpliciter_ that does not turn out to disappear into `nothing` (and vice
versa). This emphasizes the inseparability of the two categories.

Hegel then points out that these categories really are _distinct_. `Being` and
`nothing` are different conceptions, and this difference is important in
understanding the movement of `becoming`. It is insofar as `being` and `nothing`
pass over into each other&mdash;or vanish into its opposite&mdash;that a
movement has begun to take shape.

It is seen here how the immediate vanishing of `being` and `nothing` play a role
in forming an idea of movement which contains both the inseparability and
difference of the two categories. This "movement" of `becoming` establishes
something of a third element that groups the other two under a new identity, but
as already visible from the end of the quote, this unity is highly unstable.

Additionally, the term "vanishing" first appears here and is used extensively to
convey the passing of one category to the other is both immediate and absolute.
There is no further or deeper sub-process or mediation to deign here. Neither is
the passage partial or piecemeal; when one category _vanishes_ into another its
disappearance is instantaneous and total.

### The Moments of Becoming

#### Quote

> Becoming is the unseparatedness of being and nothing, not the unity that
> abstracts from being and nothing; as the unity _of being and nothing_ it is
> rather this _determinate_ unity, or one in which being and nothing equally
> _are_. However, inasmuch as being and nothing are each unseparated from its
> other, _each is not_. In this unity, therefore, _they are_, but as vanishing,
> only as _sublated_. They sink from their initially represented
> _self-subsistence_ into moments which are _still distinguished_ but at the
> same time sublated (Hegel 2010, 80/21.92).

Here Hegel stresses that `becoming` is _not_ to be understood as just the a
static unity that merely combines `being` and `nothing` side-by-side without
taking into account the nuances of their respective developments. Inasmuch as
`becoming` is regarded as the unity of the two categories it has specifically to
do with their inseparability.

However, this inseparability needs to be further qualified. If each category is
isolated with this inseparability, then it is negated on account that it does
not have any self-subsistence, reality or independence vis-à-vis the other it is
inseparable from.

Therefore, _the unity of_ `becoming` contains both categories as _moments_. This
sublated state does double work: first, it ensures the distinctiveness of each
category; second, it _also_ illustrates their inseparability through the shared
context.

Put differently, the developments of `being` and `nothing` lead to divergent
results: on the one hand, each is an immediate self-subsistent category totally
distinct from the other, but, on the other hand, each is indistinguishable from
the other and vanishes into that other, implying an undeniable inseparability.
This looks like a problem: How can these results be coherently understood
together? `Becoming` is the category that creatively combines these two results
through the idea of "moment": a logic that at once joins together while it
differentiates.

Here `becoming` is further developed into two phases. First, as the
"unseparatedness" of `being` and `nothing`. Secondly, as the "unity" of `being`
and `nothing`. Hegel makes this distinction within `becoming` following the
inseparability and difference exposed in the
[first section](#the-unity-of-being-and-nothing) since each of these signal a
different conception with regards to how the category is understood.

For example, insofar as `being` is understood to be inseparable from `nothing`,
`being` does not have any self-subsistence, reality or independence and so its
meaning of `pure being` is negated and with it the category itself ("each is
not"). And, conversely, insofar as `being` is understood to be distinct from
`nothing`, it is joined into a determinate unity with `nothing` where the two
"equally are". In the second phase, Hegel adds additional qualifiers: each
category is present equally as the other yet only as vanishing and sublated.
This is important because the categories of `being` and `nothing` are not held
together immediately&mdash;`pure being` and `pure nothing` strictly cannot
co-exist&mdash;but as mediated moments. In other words, they are not held
together in their initial immediacy but as they disappear and are turned into
moments.

{/* TODO */}

Before proceeding, it is worthwhile to note that, strictly speaking, `negation`
at this stage of the _Logic_ has not been developed. It cannot be employed to
develop the logic.
