## Why Something

Why is there something rather than nothing? What is Hegel's reply to this
question? First, consider Immanuel Kant's view on `something`.

> The _most abstract_ concept ... is the concept of _something_, for that which
> is different from it is _nothing_, and it thus has nothing in common with
> something (Kant 1992, 593/95).

For Kant, `something` is the most primitive category&mdash;alongside `nothing`.
But for Hegel, by contrast, `something` is quite a
[developed concept](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development) and
consequently much less abstract than `nothing`. In fact, for Hegel, `something`
cannot be rightly opposed to `nothing` since the former constitutes a
self-referring determinate being whereas the latter is simply just itself.
Indeed, another misalignment is that `nothing` is utterly indeterminate and is
so unstable it immediately
[_vanishes_](/articles/hegel/reference/nothing/development) whereas `something`
is qualified determinate being that sustains itself internally. Following
Hegel's logic, therefore, Kant's intuition&mdash;a quite widespread
intuition&mdash;does not hold since the two categories in question should never
be compared in that manner.

With the common notion disentangled, it becomes clearer why for Hegel there must
be `something` rather than mere `nothing`. Taking `nothing` on its own
terms&mdash;without referring to `something`&mdash;it vanishes into `being` and
jump-starts the development of `becoming`, and further on `existence` and
`quality`, which finally prove to be `something`. In short, there is something
rather than nothing _because_ `nothing` _proves to be_ `something`.

This is a fine example of
[presuppositionless thinking](/articles/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking).
The question has a false start since it takes it for granted that `something`
exists (is already determinate) and freezes in place the idea of `nothing`. To
remedy this, one simply needs inquire into the nature of each category
independently in order to grasp that `nothing` and `something` are not opposites
and do not form a good comparison. Loosely speaking, opposite correlate of
`nothing` is `being` and of `something` it is the `other`. The more accurate
speculative questions are, then, why is there not just nothing&mdash;or why can
`nothing` not merely be&mdash;and why is there not _just_ something, why must
there _also_ be an other? The answer, taking up Hegel's approach, is within the
categories themselves.
