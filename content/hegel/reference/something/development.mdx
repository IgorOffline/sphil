## The Development of Something

### Quality Undermines Itself

The category `something` (_Etwas_) develops out of
[`quality`](/articles/hegel/reference/quality/development), which itself
progressed from
[`existence` as such](/articles/hegel/reference/existence/development).

> In existence its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in this

`Quality` is the determinateness of `existence`. More specifically, `existence`
is either specified in terms of `reality` or `negation`. Crudely put, it signals
that which is real and that which is not there. Hegel emphasizes that
determinateness exists. It is not to be thought of as something separate from
existence or as that which lacks existence, since to qualify something as not
being there counts, in Hegel's eyes, as equally determining as qualifying
something as being real. Indeed, the two are logically inseparable.

```
Now though these distinctions are present in existence,
they are just as much null and sublated.
```

Hegel presses the idea that `reality` contains `negation` and vice versa, and in
so doing must designate them as sublated. Insofar as each is _contained_ in the
other, it has thereby rendered itself a moment of it. This signals that more is
at play than merely `reality` and `negation` since their mutual containment
points towards a higher context. Genealogically, their ancestor, so to speak, is
`existence` and so it would be their natural common identifier. However, it has
been discovered that this is essentially but one side of `quality`. The higher
context, therefore, must be that which contains both in their present
arrangement.
