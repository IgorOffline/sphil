## The Development of Something

### Quality Undermines Itself

The category `something` (_Etwas_) develops out of
[`quality`](/articles/hegel/reference/quality/development), which itself
progressed from
[`existence` as such](/articles/hegel/reference/existence/development).

> In existence its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in this
> quality as something existing, the distinction _exists_ &ndash; the

`Quality` is the determinateness of `existence`. More specifically, `existence`
is either specified in terms of `reality` or `negation`. Crudely put, it signals
that which is real and that which is not there. Hegel emphasizes that
determinateness exists. It is not to be thought of as something separate from
existence or as that which lacks existence, since to qualify something as not
being there counts, in Hegel's eyes, as equally as qualifying something as being
real. Indeed, the two are logically inseparable.

```
Now though these distinctions are present in existence,
they are just as much null and sublated.
```

Hegel presses the idea that `reality` contains `negation` and vice versa, and in
so doing must designate them as sublated. Insofar as each is _contained_ in the
other, it has thereby rendered itself a moment of it. This signals that more is
at play than merely `reality` and `negation` since their mutual containment
points towards a higher context. Genealogically, their ancestor, so to speak, is
`existence` and so it would be their natural common identifier. However, it has
been discovered that this is essentially but one side of `quality`. The higher
context, therefore, must be that which contains both in their present
arrangement.

### Something Emerges

[^1]:
    The German is _Insichsein_, and not _Ansichsein_, which is the term usually
    translated to `being-in-itself` (see Houlgate 2022, 172).

The distinction of `quality` is undermined inasmuch as this distinction is to
hold absolutely. The distinction, rather, has sublated itself into a moment.
Now, while Hegel then warns that this does not yield a complete return to the
beginning of `existence` as such, there _is_ a return to `existence` in the
development. The qualitative distinction has proved to necessarily follow from
`existence`. What remains, then is to understand precisely this movement of
_return_.

```md
existence in general, distinction in it, and the sublation of this distinction;
the existence, not void of distinction as at the beginning, but as _again_
self-equal _through the sublation of the distinction_; the simplicity of
existence _mediated_ through this sublation
```

`Existence` is returned to through the sublation of distinction (or
determinateness), but it is important to emphasize exactly that it is _through_
the developments of `quality` that this occurs.

There is a small but significant difference between `existence` as such and
`existence` that is returned to through the mediation of `quality`. This is the
simple fact that the second `existence` (returned) is _mediated_ whereas the
first is _immediate_. This point is significant once the whole development is
viewed together.

To briefly recap: `Quality` is a development of `existence`, indeed, it is the
existent _determinateness_. Likewise, `existence` is determined, or _qualified_,
through it. However, when `quality` is looked at more closely, it becomes
apparent how its two forms `reality` and `negation` form moments of one another.
This then showed that neither form is absolute and independent, and furthermore,
that `quality` itself proves to be a moment. But what is `quality` a moment of?

There is nowhere for determinateness to go, so to speak, than back to where it
came from, namely, `existence`. In fact, this is already built into
determinateness, since it was understood that determinateness is _existent_.

The distinction therefore is `existence`'s _own_ distinction. The difference
_of_ `existence` or the existent difference. The development thus traced is one
whereby determinacy is emitted from existent being and then, from within this
determinacy, it is reabsorbed back into its source. Yet it is not annihilated
upon its return, but made itself a moment that contained within another as that
being's _own_.

This generates an _internality_ to `existence` that is not evident in its
immediacy. This internal `being` that is differentiated within itself as such is
`being-within-itself` or `something`.

```md
This state of sublation of the distinction is existence's own determinateness;
existence is thus [ _being-within-itself_ ]; it is _existent_, _something_.
```

Three things should be noted in the development of the category `something` so
far. First, with internality, a sense of _context_ has been achieved. With
context, layers and depth in the logic become possible. Second, a sense of
_ownership_ has been introduced into the logic: `quality` is now understood to
_belong_ to something. Determinateness is no longer free-standing but inherent
within a specific context. Finally, ownership hints at the idea&mdash;however
minimal&mdash;of singularity. Determinateness becomes individual and particular
to an specific context.

This portion of the quote was cut because it seems to focus on commenting on the
logical development rather than advancing it, but it is kept here because it

What is the negation of negation? This pattern of a term or movement that is
applied itself&mdash;like
[the vanishing of the vanishing](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development#quiescent-result-and-destruction)&mdash;must
also _refer_ to itself being applied. Said otherwise, `negation` qualifies that
which is _not_, but when applied to `negation` itself this essentially means
that _not_ is not. This looks like a paradox since `negation` cannot be negated
by `negation` without wholly undermining itself: to negate `negation` would mean
that `negation` ceases entirely such that nothing is actually negated. It would
be like trying tell oneself to stop over-thinking by focusing on the need to
stop, which is futile. Is this what Hegel has in mind?

Rather than an outright contradiction, Hegel focuses on the element of
_self-reference_ when first dealing with the `negation` of `negation`. There is
an identity of the two negations, but necessarily there must be difference,
since the first `negation` _negates_ the second. But what the first `negation`
negates is, unavoidably, itself. However, because it _is_ negated, `negation`
itself ceases to be _merely_ `negation`. The `negation of negation`, then, is a
compound logical term that distinguishes a being with qualities of its own;
layered and internal to it. To borrow from Hegel's example, "squirrel-ness"
would be something merely qualitative and generic while "a squirrel" would
actually be _some thing_. `Something` is the determination that allows one to
pass from generalities&mdash;whether it is existence, life, thought, God,
etc.&mdash;to a being that holds its determination _as its own_.

Hegel states that `something` is the beginning of the `subject`. The `subject`
belongs to the `the concept` much later in the development of the logic, so what
Hegel says here is highlighting what is to come. But `something` _is_ the
beginning of the `subject` insofar as the `subject` later will employ primitives
that are developed at this stage of the logic, namely, internality, context,
depth and negative unity. The negative unity being specifically the
`negation of negation`. Note, however, that `something` does _not_ equal the
subject nor any mature terms like living being or a thinking mind. Even though
`something` the most minimal form of a being that is in itself, this
determination is still utmost general and abstract.

> _Something_ is an _existent_ as the negation of negation, for such a negation

It is found that the `negation of negation` is not accidental or optional to
`something` but vital to its very existence. When looked back at the development
of `existence` and `quality`, `negation of negation` at first really only
signifies the _return_ back to `existence` from `quality`; but this return
enriches `existence` from merely being an immediate oneness of `being` and
`non-being` to a mediated unity of `reality` and `negation`. But what turns
`existence` particularly into `something` is not only the moment of _return_ but
also that the entire development _of_ `existence` is _through_
`existence`&mdash;the qualifying and subsequent sublation of its
determinateness. Essentially, the `existence` that mediates itself with itself
_is_ `something`. This is the potency in the self-reference of the
`negation of negation` whereby `existence` ceases to be _mere_ `existence` and
in so doing actually _becomes more_ `existence`&mdash;this _more_ is the posited
mediation of `existence` with itself; the process of its determinateness
unveiling itself and rendered unified as a simple identity: `something`.

Hegel also points back to the category `becoming` as the site where a similar
mediation of itself with itself occurred. However, this mediation was utterly
abstract in the sense that the constituents of that mediation could not be
coherently wed together. In `something`, by contrast, the mediation is
relatively concrete inasmuch as the constituents form a coherent whole:
`negation of negation` negotiates the process whereby an existent refers to
itself in its determinateness without being completely beholden to it through an
ownership that is essentially of itself with itself. What is missing from that
phrase, as will be made apparent in developments to come, is that this mediation
of itself with itself is inert without negativity.

### Collapse into Being and Return to Becoming

> This mediation with itself which something is _in itself_, when taken only as
> the negation of negation, has no concrete determinations for its sides; thus
> it collapses into the simple unity which is _being_. Something _is_, and _is_
> therefore also an existent (Hegel 2010, 89-90/21.104).

It important to note the shift in focus here. Hegel attends to _the mediation_
that inheres in `something`, rather than discussing `something` as such. He then
goes on to claim that as sheer `negation of negation` it is not distinguished
against any other elements; like `becoming`, it is currently the highest context
of the development; but unlike `becoming` neither it to its moments nor its
moments between themselves exhibit contradiction and the resolution is a
collapse (_fällt_) to `being`. Why does the mediation collapse into `being`? And
why does the `negation of negation` have no "determinations for its sides"?

The `negation of negation` has no determinations for its sides because it is the
total mediation of `existence` to `quality` to `existence`. And, furthermore,
this mediation does not suffer the contradiction of sheer `becoming`, rendering
it coherent and complete. In other words, the `negation of negation` spells out
the movement latent in `existence` whereby it ceases to be understood _merely_
as `existence` but, rather, as `something`. For this reason, the mediation
effectively ceases, since there is no further determination left at this point;
the movement has successfully shown that self-mediating existent determinateness
picks out `something` and, following this, the mediation unravels into `being`.

```md
Something _is_, and _is_ therefore also an existent.
```

This sentence appears to sum the current development unless it is read
speculatively: `something`, particularly when focused on its mediation,
collapses into `being`, and, re-running the development of pure `being` again,
`existence` is (once more) developed. It is thus seen how the development of
`something` loops back to the beginning of the logic.

> Further, it is _in itself_ (_an sich_) also becoming, but a becoming that no
> longer has only being and nothing for its moments. One of these moments,
> being, is now existence and further an existent. The other moment is equally
> an existent, but determined as the negative of something &ndash; an _other_.
> As becoming, something is a transition, the moments of which are themselves
> something, and for that reason it is an _alteration_ &ndash; a becoming that
> has already become _concrete_ (Hegel 2010, 90/21.104).

While the logic appears to loop back to the beginning, it is _only the
mediation_ of `something` that undergoes this. `Something` as such, must be kept
in view. Indeed, it in the _context of_ `something` that its mediation collapses
into `being` and re-develops from therein. Now, Hegel claims that from this
context, the development of `becoming` is modified: `becoming` under the
`negation of negation` does not have `being` and `nothing` for its moments, but
`existence`. As `existence`, the developments of `quality` and `something`
follow such that the `becoming of something` is made up of a pair of `something`
as its moments. This is confirmed when Hegel writes:

```md
As becoming, something is a transition, the moments of which are themselves
something
```

However, two difference emerges between these two `something-as-becoming`
moments. First, Hegel claims that both moments are equally `existence`, or
qualitative determinateness, but that _one_ of them is determined as the
negative of `something`. This negative is called the `other` (_Anderes_). Why is
one of them determined this way?

While Hegel does not provide a direct reason in the development here, it can be
inferred from the logic of `becoming` that its two moments must be
differentiated. As `becoming` is the movement of two immediately different
elements, and `existence` does come in two forms, then one of these forms must
be different from the other. Insofar as `becoming` here takes place, two
identical moments are precluded.

Second, as the movement of `becoming` in the context of `something` is no longer
that of vanishing moments but of `somethings`, there is no vanishing of the
vanishing but, rather, an _alteration_ (_Veränderung_). The
`becoming of something` therefore, alternates or changes between its two
moments, `something` and `other`.

### Overengineered Development of the Other? (Niklas)

Hegel's account of the development of the other or the culminating progress at
the end of [`something`](#collapse-into-being-and-return-to-becoming) raises a
number of issues. First, he invokes the category `becoming` but modifies its
moments. The `becoming` that was
[developed](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development) specifically did so
with `being` and `nothing` as its moments. There is no reason why swapping out
these moments would not also alter the context that they inhabit. In fact, given
how intimately bound moments are within their context in the _Logic_ one would
assume that it would.

Second, `something` is momentarily designated _as_ `becoming`, which itself _has
moments_ that are differentiated. On the one hand, there is no clear reason why
a later category should take on the logic of a former one. It is as if one were
to put on a shirt as an adult that one wore as a child&mdash;it does not fit! On
the other hand, if `something` does have moments, then why must these be
differentiated? Why can the moments not simply be two `somethings`? And,
furthermore, one has at hand not two `somethings` but _three_, namely, the two
moments and the one that contains the two others as its moments.

The argument here is error prone and unconvincing, but there is a solution.

The mediation of `something` collapses into being and it is sufficient to just
_let_ that mediation re-develop back to `something` while the first `something`
is still the case. The second `something` will be an `other` because it is what
is specifically _mediated_ by _an other_ `something`, unlike the first
`something` which emerged immanently from `existence` as such.

Why is the first `something` still held in view? The first `something` is still
the case precisely because it is the category with _internality_ and what is
focused in the final development is not `something` as such but its
`being-within-itself`, which is what collapses into `being`. Given `being` is
once more at hand, as `pure being`, it will (re-)develop to `something` once
more, but as mentioned above, it is now understood that _this_ `something` is
_mediated by another_ and so is immediately an `other`.

This development is simpler and takes much less for granted, while attaining the
same result and, moreover, shows why an `other` _is_ an `other` at the moment of
its arrival.

## Further Commentary

### Burbidge

John Burbidge writes that `something` is the integrated unity of the determinate
quality "some" and the basic reality "thing". "In this synthetic act of
integrating _a being_ with its _quality_, speculative reason negates the
negation" (Burbidge 1981, 47). Based on this, Burbidge claims, thought discovers
an active process of relating, which subsequently leads to the discovery of the
`other`.

> It is not simply the case that _a being_ is qualified immediately; it becomes
> qualified; a movement of thought is involved. But this distinguishes between
> what it was before, and what it becomes. The first is _something_; the second
> is qualified, but in some way different form the first. It is something
> _else_, an _other_ (Burbidge 1981, 47).

Speculative reason has brought two terms, _a being_ and _quality_ together into
the concept `something` by making explicit the process where one leads to the
other. However, Burbidge notes, this does not achieve a unity but the exact
opposite: "The analysis of the process has resulted in distinguishing two
contrasting moments: _something_ and _something else_. Thought no longer has a
simple concept, but wavers between two" (Burbidge 1981, 48). Consequently,
thought has introduced a more radical contrast instead of the intended
integration.

Burbidge's account on `something` is sparse and uses terms, such as synthesis
and "thing", which may assume too much. However, his high-level view of the
development is nonetheless instructive.

### Houlgate

Stephen Houlgate writes that both forms of quality are, while sublated, definite
and irreducible. However, he adds that with each differing from its
other&mdash;`reality` differing from `negation`&mdash;the two sides are also the
same: "each is what the other is. In differing from the other, therefore, each
relates not just to an other, but to _itself_. It encounters itself _in_ the
other" (Houlgate 2022, 170).

There are two senses in which this can be understood. In the first sense, as
both forms of `quality`, the difference between `reality` and `negation` is one
in which `quality` relates to _itself_. And, in the second sense, as `reality`
and `negation` both _contain_ one another, "the difference between them is one
in which each individually relates to itself in the other: reality relates to
itself in negation and vice versa" (Houlgate 2022, 170).

In both cases, Houlgate claims, a new logical structure has emerged: neither
just immediate nor just determinate, but what is explicitly _self-relating_. As
`something`, being takes the form of a difference between sides, each of which
is the same and thereby it relates explicitly to itself.

> Note that being can be explicitly self-relating, _only_ because it contains a
> difference between moments that are the same, a difference that is “sublated”.
> Self-relating being cannot, therefore, occur imdevelopingmediately: it cannot
> simply _be_ there, just like that. It can arise only through the _mediation_
> of difference and its sublation (Houlgate 2022, 170).

Through this division and self-relating, `existence` is a space of "ownness" or
minimal "selfhood", such that this sublation of `quality` can be said to be
`existences`'s (_Dasein_) _own_ determinacy. From this, self-relating
`existence` achieves a logical interior previously unavailable to prior
categories, such that it is the being that is "within itself" (_in sich_).

It is when being is self-relating in this way, Houlgate writes, that "it is what
it is _by itself_" (Houlgate 2022, 170). He stresses that this is really the
first time in the logic that being _is_ itself rather than mere immediacy or
determinacy. This being is then cast as _a_ determinate being or `something`.
However, `something` is not merely _that which relates to itself_ (this is what
`quality` is), rather, `something` is that which is constituted: "there is no
something prior to the emergence of self-relation: there is not first something
_which_ then relates to itself. Rather, there is quality _which_ relates to
itself, in so doing, proves to be _self-relating_ being or 'something'"
(Houlgate 2022, 173).

On the derivation of the `other` (see Hegel 2010, 89-90/21.104), Houlgate finds
that the remark concerning `becoming` is not justified by the current
development of `something`. However, he reads it as a anticipatory remark on
what `something` will later prove to be. Notably, `something` does not prove to
be _change_ (_Veränderung_) until later. Nevertheless, there is an immanent
logical reason for the development of `other`, Houlgate writes:

> This becomes apparent when we recall that quality, which gives rise logically
> to something, comprises the two moments of reality and negation, and when we
> render fully explicit the fact that each moment relates to _itself_ in
> differing from the other (because each is contained in the other from which it

> ... There must be something because quality is self-relating; there must be
> something and an _other_, however, because quality itself takes the twin forms
> of reality and negation (Houlgate 2022, 176).

Houlgate's argument here depends on `reality` and `negation` _relating_ to
itself _in_ differing from the other, but it is not clear if this step is
actually taken in the logic. To be more precise, such a step amount to a
movement of _return_ for each of the moments in question, such that `reality`
relates to `negation` which relates again to `reality`. But this kind of
movement of return _only_ first emerges with `something`, namely, with
`existence` returning to itself. It is doubtful whether such self-relation is
the case with `reality` and `negation` as such, and if they should be understood
to have any internality.

Furthermore, while each category could be loosely said to relate to itself in
differing form its other&mdash;considering `reality` and `negation`&mdash;this
kind of distinguishing cannot strictly advance the logic. This is because such
_relational_ logic belongs properly to the logic of essence. It is in
`necessity`, for example, that one begins to see patterns of "_identity of being
with itself_ in its negation" (Hegel 2010, 488/11.392). In contrast, the case
with `reality` and `negation` must be simpler; they each point to the other and
contain (or conceal) the other in itself, but that is sufficient for their
sublation.

Therefore, Houlgate's derivation of the `other` rests on assumptions that might
not hold. `Reality` and `negation` might not be self-relating out of which
`something` and `other` develop concurrently.

### McTaggart

John McTaggart writes that `something` is "the explicit introduction of
plurality ... a rudimentary form of plurality of substance, rather than
plurality of attributes" (McTaggart 1910, 23-4). The latter requires a
conception of a thing with a plurality of attributes, which McTaggart thinks is
at this stage not developed in the logic. Therefore, there must be a plurality
of `somethings`: "Each of these ise dependent for its nature on not being the
others" (McTaggart 1910, 25).

McTaggart reading rests on the argument that `negation` does exist, through
inverting the fact that `something` cannot have qualities (as properties).

> ...it may be said, if this Something is _x_, there must, by the results we
> have already reached, be some _y_, which is not, but it does not follow that
> _y_ exists. If an existent object is red, it must be not-green, but it does
> not follow that any green object exists. Thus, it is urged, there might, for
> anything we have proved to the contrary, be only one existent Something, whose
> definite nature consisted in the fact that it was _x_, and was not _y_, _z_,
> etc (McTaggart 1910, 24).

If `something` cannot have qualities, but, rather, _is_ the `quality`, then
there must be a plurality of the former.

The introduction of plurality is problematic since it appears to employ
quantitative logic, which is developed later in Hegel's _Logic_, and would thus
violate the presuppositionless development. Instead, Hegel's argument might be
more minimal, namely, that qualitative determinateness necessarily connects
`reality` to `negation` (and vice versa) but that these are moments of
`something`, whose mediation further necessitates the emergence of an `other`.
There no need to evoke plurality here, save for trying to apply the logic to a
concrete situation, but in that case one would no longer be developing the
matter but instantiating what has already been developed.
