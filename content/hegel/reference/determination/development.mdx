## The Development of Determination

### Qualified Through Another

The category `determination` (_Bestimmung_) follows the development of
[`something and other`](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/development),
and emerges as a new form of specifying how one form of being is expressed
through another.

> The quality which in the simple something is an in-itself essentially in unity
> with the something's other moment, its _being-in-it_, can be named its
> _determination_, provided that this word is distinguished, in a more precise
> signification, from _determinateness_ in general (Hegel 2010, 95/21.110).

`Determination` should be distinguished from `determinateness` in the sense that
the former signifies how a `quality` belongs to a particular `something`
inasmuch as it itself related to others, whereas the latter signifies a
`quality` in general. In other words, the difference is between what is at home
with itself through another in contrast to just what is. Moreover,
`determination` also carries with it the connotations "vocation" or "destiny",
suggesting a momentum at work in how something expresses itself or comes to be
defined in relation to others or in its circumstances. Hegel continues:

> Determination is affirmative determinateness; it is the in-itself by which a
> something abides in its existence while involved with an other that would
> determine it, by which it preserves itself in its self-equality, holding on to
> it in its being-for-other. Something _fulfills_ its determination to the
> extent that the further determinateness, which variously accrues to it in the
> measure of its being-in-itself as it relates to an other, becomes its filling.
> Determination implies that what something is _in itself_ is also _present in
> it_ (Hegel 2010, 95-6/21.110-1).

Something's `determination` is the quality that is embedded in it which allows
it to be outwardly expressed yet also inwardly defined, since the
`determination` is precisely that through which something preserves itself.

The terms "fulfills" and "filling" appear to express the logic in terms of a
container that has a certain capacity. While this may foreshadow later notions,
it is important to note that there is no leeway in terms of whether
`determination` maps on adequately or inadequately, in merely in some volume, to
the thing in question. Inasmuch as `determination` is established, its `quality`
at hand determines what the thing is.

Hegel uses the example of "the determination of the human being", and writes
that its determination&mdash;its vocation&mdash;is rational thought. The human
being is distinguished from other animals by being a thinking being. However, it
is especially important to note that thinking is also _in_ the human being:
"...thinking is in his existence and his existence is in his thinking, thinking
is _concrete_, must be taken as having content and filling; it is rational
thought and as such the _determination_ of the human being" (Hegel 2010,
96/21.111). This signals what is peculiar about `determination`, namely, that
not only does the thing in question have a certain `quality` embedded on it, but
this thing in question _lives_, as it were, through this `quality`; something
about this `quality` enables the thing to be the thing it is, just as thinking
enables the human being to be _human_.

To use another example, one could say that "self-movement is the determination
of animals", by which one understands that moving oneself is a fundamental
quality of being animal and that the animal exists through this quality.

Now, Hegel adds an important detail with regards to his example of the
determination of the human being:

> But even this determination is again only _in itself_, as an _ought_, that is
> to say, it is, together with the filling embodied in its in-itself, in the
> form of an in-itself in general _as against_ the existence which is not
> embodied in it but still lies outside confronting it, immediate sensibility
> and nature (Hegel 2010, 96/21.111).

`Determination` thus not only establishes what a certain being is, but sets up
an opposition between that being vis-รก-vis _other_ being (or the lack thereof).
With thought as the determination of the human being, the human being becomes
pinned against all other being that confronts this `determination`, such as
immediate sensibility and nature. Likewise, with animals, self-movement
distinguishes the animal from all other things that are stationary or merely by
virtue of other things (such as natural forces or laws). In both cases, the
human being or the animal _abide_ in their being insofar as they are
distinguished from other things. Indeed, thought or self-movement are ways in
which these _relate_ to other things and are present with themselves _in_ this
relation. It seen how `being-for-other` and `being-in-itself` can form aspects
of `determination`, but that the latter is exactly irreducible to either; it is
_both_ at once.

### Constituting Constitution

While `determination` defines the gateway whereby something is present with
itself in its relation to other things, there is a purely external side to this
relation that does not belong to the `being-in-itself` of the something at hand.

> The filling of the being-in-itself with determinateness is also distinct from
> the determinateness which is only being-for-other and remains outside the
> determination. For in the sphere of the qualitative, the distinguished terms
> are left, in their sublated being, also with an immediate, qualitative being
> contrasting them (Hegel 2010, 96/21.111).

Mention has already been made between `determination` and determinateness,
whereby the former designates the `quality` into which `something` expands as
its own&mdash;or where `something` is present with itself through
another&mdash;and the latter designates a determinateness or specificity more
generally. Hegel now focuses on exactly this difference and points out that
there is an independent `quality` that contrasts that of the `determination`.

> That which the something has _in it_ thus separates itself and is from this
> side the external existence of the something and also _its_ existence, but not
> as belonging to its being-in-itself. &ndash; Determinateness is thus
> _constitution_ (Hegel 2010, 96/21.111).

`Constitution` defines what does _not_ belong to the thing in question, but
instead emphasizes the externality of the relationship a thing has with others,
namely, that the external is connected to the thing itself. In a way,
`constitution` revives the former `being-for-other` and `being-in-itself` dyad
but sharpens the difference by establishing that the relation to others involves
an externality that falls outside of something's `determination`.

## Further Commentary

### Burbidge

John Burbidge writes that `something` is _determined_ by being "other-directed",
such that it also becomes _determinate_. But each of these processes of being
_determined_ and being _determinate_ collapse to one: "Each process mediates the
other. For when something is determinate, it has been determined. Equally, when
something is determined, it becomes determinate. In both the determining
activity of thought renders the concept determinate. This single determining
process can be called _determination_" (Burbidge 1981, 49).

More specifically, Burbidge notes the passage that occurs in thought when
thinking about `something` and `other`, and that distinguishing this passage is
effectively what `determination` renders explicit: "In the move from _something_
to _other_ this act of determining was only implicitly present. Now the
distinction has become explicit, independent category" (Burbidge 1981, 49). He
goes on to add that it is not a foreign imputation upon the thing just because
an outside relation is involved:

> A _determination- is not an alien feature applied to something simply because
> it is in relation; it is what something is \_in itself_. In becoming
> determinate, something fulfills its determination. What is implicit becomes
> explicit; what is inherent becomes the way it is determined (Burbidge 1981,
> 50).

However, he notes that this category remains logically incomplete as its
relation to its substantive being is merely assumed, not made explicit. This
occurs next when the `determination` of `something` is further distinguished
from others that are extrinsic and contingent. These latter are not constituted
by the thing in itself but through its contact with others. To refine it
further, what is not inherent in the `determination` of `something` reflects an
into an implicit being of contingent and changeable relations termed
`constitution`. "In so far as something changes while remaining the same the
change takes place in this relatively superficial area of its \_constitution"
(Burbidge 1981, 50).

### Houlgate

Stephen Houlgate reads `determination` as the intrinsic being of `something` in
its relation with, and present in, the thing's relation to others. "It is this
intrinsic being conceives as touch _other_ things. Indeed, it is the intrinsic
being or character of a thing which it preserves and 'asserts' (_geltend macht_)
in its relation to others" (Houlgate 2022, 193). Furthermore, this
`being-in-itself` is not what merely remains as true in `something's`
entanglement with an `other`, but what that `something` fulfills _by adhering
to_ and _affirming_ its own identity in dealings with others, "thereby
determining _by itself_ how it relates to them" (Houlgate 2022, 193).

The two moments of `something`&mdash;`being-for-other` and
`being-in-itself`&mdash;are _united_ in the thing's `determination`. Despite
this, the moments remain different, as each is the `non-being` of the other,
given a "lingering immediacy that keeps each qualitative category distinct in
some sense from the other to which it is bound" (Houlgate 2022, 193). For this
reason, a thing's `being-in-itself` is not simply coextensive with its
`being-for-other`; "what a thing is in itself does, indeed, manifest itself in
its relations to others, but it turns out that what the thing is for others is
not itself exhausted by what the thing is in itself" (Houlgate 2022, 194).
Therefore, the thing's `being-for-other` must take two different forms.

The first of the two forms that a thing's `being-for-other` must take is the one
_determined_ by the thing's intrinsic being: "it is the other-relatedness in
which something asserts what it is _in itself_ against its other" (Houlgate
2022, 194). This is the thing's `determination`.

The second form of a thing's `being-for-other` is what is _not_ determined by
the thing's intrinsic being. This is called `constitution`. "This is a form of
the thing's own other-relatedness &ndash; a way in which _it_ relates to an
other &ndash; and so belongs _to_ the thing; yet it 'does not belong to its
being-in-itself' and so is not governed by the thing itself" (Houlgate 2022,
194). The `constitution` is the form of a thing's relation to others that is
part of a thing but is not _determined by_ or "controlled" by the thing's
intrinsic "nature" or `being-in-itself`.
