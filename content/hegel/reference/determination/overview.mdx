## Overview of Determination

`Determination` (_Bestimmung_) refers to the way something expresses its
essential quality through its relation to others, yet remains inwardly defined
and self-related. Hegel emphasizes that this internal quality is not merely
imposed by external forces but is intrinsic to the thing's being&mdash;its
vocation or destiny. In contrast, `constitution` captures the external side of
these relations, aspects that belong to a thing's existence but do not stem from
its essence.
