## The Development of Something and Other

### The Other

`Other` is first determined at the end of the
[the development of `something`](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development)
and the two now form a pair that progress the logic further. Before looking at
that development, however, a semantic issue needs to be settled: is an `other`
actually a category in its own right and not merely a reflection of `something`?

Both `something` and `other` are each determined as
[`existents`](/articles/hegel/reference/existence/development) as well as
`something` in its own right. An `other` is just as much a `something` in its
own right. Their difference may appear to be merely semantic, such as a sentence
ordering&mdash;for example, this bulletin is different from that other
one&mdash;such that `something` and `other` are essentially the _same_ (see
Hegel 2010, 90-91/21.105-106). Hegel, however, claims that there is a logical
difference between the two determinations, and that the `other` is a particular
determination in its own right: "_other_, as posited at first, though an other
with reference to something, is other also _for itself apart from the
something_" (Hegel 2010, 91/21.106).

Hegel illustrates this in the common usage of nature, particularly as it is
regarded as _other_ of human self-conscious activity or _spirit_. At first, the
determinateness of nature expresses a mere relativity&mdash;a _something
different_ from the matter at hand&mdash;but what is implied in this is not that
the externality of nature merely exists within self-conscious thought as such,
but that externality is a quality of nature itself: "taken for itself the
quality of nature is just this, to be the other within, that
_which-exists-outside-itself_" (Hegel 2010, 92/21.106).

Coincidentally, the term nature encompasses its own set of concepts which are
each determined and developed through the primitives of space, time and
matter&mdash;categories which are precisely further concrete elaborations on the
theme of _that which-exists-outside-itself_. It is important to remember,
however, that while nature may exemplify the idea of the `other`, the concept of
the `other` does not logically depend on nature; one does not need to appeal to
nature in order to conceptualize otherness. Hegel develops this concept of the
`other` entirely out of the concept of `something`, immanently.

While it is not yet clear why `other` is a category distinct from `something`, a
couple of clues may act as helpful stepping stones towards that understanding.
First, there _is_ a distinction to be made between a `something` that entirely
and immanently develops from pure `being` and the `something` that _is_ as the
result of an _other_ `something`. Second, the distinction between an immediate
`something` and a mediated `something` holds&mdash;or, does not
collapse&mdash;because the quality of being `something` means to have a
`being-within-itself` or an _internality_, such that the two `somethings` cannot
collapse into one. Instead, the two `somethings` must form a new difference
_vis-á-vis_ one another. Additionally, this new difference cannot be relational
or a concrete unity, since that would require a third element to bind the other
two, which would be presupposing too much. Rather, the difference must be
contained within each `something`, perhaps as the feature of being `something`.

### The Other of the Other

Not only is the `other` a determinateness that applies with regards to
`something`, two `somethings` (non-quantitatively) or `something` and `other`,
but it also applies to the `other` as such. This yields the peculiar notion that
an `other` is an `other` to itself. To borrow a different term: externality is
external to itself.

This conception of `the other of the other` produces two absolutely contrary
determinations. First, by virtue of being `_other_`, the inner `other` is
completely unequal to the outer `other`, and since this determination _is_
within the `other`, it essentially negates itself or, as Hegel puts it, _alters_
(_verändert_) itself. Second, by the same token, the inner `other` is perfectly
identical to the outer `other` since they are both equally `other`, such that
the `other` thereby rejoins itself as it is. This movement of "othering" servers
to change the `other` but what it changes into is nothing else than `other`
again.

but that which alters itself is not determined in any other way than in this, to
be an other; in going over to this other, it only unites with itself.
```

The first instinct might be to conclude that no change took place in this
"othering". But reading Hegel carefully, it is understood that the first
determination of `the other of the other`&mdash;that the inner and outer `other`
_are_ unequal&mdash;does in fact take place without reference to the second. The
first determination thus is not dependent on the second for its validity, and so
the second does not have the authority to revoke the determination of the first.
Granted that the `other` _is_ `other` to itself, the second determination
necessarily follows.

The second determination&mdash;that the inner and other `other` _are_
equal&mdash;does also in fact run completely counter to the first. It really
does appear that a contradiction follows from `the other of the other`; but this
precisely displays the _movement_ of change itself whereby an element of
difference _and_ identity are necessarily both contained. In everyday parlance,
this is readily grasped and accepted: it does not make sense to say a matter has
changed if there is not some unity between its two states, but likewise it does
not make sense to say that there is no difference, since then there would be no
different states to speak of. Change, it seems, must incorporate these two
elements. What Hegel shows here is how change minimally develops from the
"inside-out", as it were, by thinking logically what follows from the idea of
`other` when the category is turned upon itself.
