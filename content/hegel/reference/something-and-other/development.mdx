## The Development of Something and Other

### The Other

`Other` is first determined at the end of the
[the development of `something`](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development)
and the two now form a pair that progress the logic further. Before looking at
that development, however, a semantic issue needs to be settled: is an `other`
actually a category in its own right and not merely a reflection of `something`?

Both `something` and `other` are each
[`existents`](/articles/hegel/reference/existence/development) and `something`.
An `other` is just as much a `something` in its own right. Their difference may
appear to be merely semantic, an ordering in the sentence&mdash;for example,
this bulletin is different from that other one&mdash;such that `something` and
`other` are essentially the _same_ (see Hegel 2010, 90-91/21.105-106). Hegel,
however, claims that there is a logical difference between the two
determinations, and that the `other` is a particular determination in its own
right: "_other_, as posited at first, though an other with reference to
something, is other also _for itself apart from the something_ (Hegel 2010,
91/21.106)".
