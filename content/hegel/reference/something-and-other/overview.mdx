## Something and Other

`Something` and `other` continues the development begun by the sole `something`
by first attending more closely to the newly developed category of `other`.
Then, it is shown how its interconnectedness with `something` reveals the more
fine-grained determinations of `being-for-other` and `being-in-itself`. Finally,
`being-for-other` and `being-in-itself` prove to be moments of the same
`something` that exists through them, making evident a new form of
determination.

Hegel's account of `something` and `other` has wide ranging consequences for
wider philosophy, particularly Kant's _Transcendental Philosophy_, since both
philosophers appear to be at odds regarding the precise status of how something
[changes](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/change-without-time) or
how it can be
[known](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/nothing-is-in-itself-without-the-other),
metaphysically or epistemologically.
