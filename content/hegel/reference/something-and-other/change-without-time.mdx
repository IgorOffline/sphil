## Change Without Time

Hegel's account of `something` and `other` develops a minimal idea of change
through `becoming-other`, which differs from sheer
[`becoming`](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development). This conception of
change is provocative since it is an idea of change that does _not_ presuppose
time.

    This article builds on the
    [development](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/development) of
    `something` and `other`, and it is strongly recommended to read it first.

During the
[development](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/development) of
`something` and `other`, Stephen Houlgate notes that `the other` must also be
negatively related to itself. "Its self-relation must," Houlgate writes,
"consist in _self-negation_, or in being other than itself" (Houlgate 2022,
181). This process of "becoming other" is called "change" or "alteration": "The
nature of the other", Houlgate continues, "is not only to stand apart from
another thing, but also, in so doing, to _change_" (Houlgate 2022, 181). In this
respect, the logical development once more proves to be more dynamic rather than
settled and stable. A new form of "becoming" has been re-introduced by the
`other`; a "becoming" of `becoming-other` or of "othering" oneself.

This in stark contrast to Kant, who maintains in the _Critique of Pure Reason_
that all change in the sphere of appearances presupposes time (i.e. something
that _lasts_).

> which already exists? (Kant 1998, 303/A188).

As Houlgate points out, Hegel's conception of change here does not presuppose
time or an alteration in time. Change _can_ be conceptualized as a process of
`becoming-other` that does require time. This is not to say that change in more
concrete things in experience _do_ require change, but the _Logic_ here does not
endeavor to provide an account of temporal, worldly change, but conceptualizing
change as such. Hegel's aim, as Houlgate writes, "is rather to show that, even
in the absence of time, every something must change, purely by virtue of being
other. Time is thus not the ultimate source of change; the latter is made
necessary by the simple fact that there is something and something else at all"
(Houlgate 2022, 182).

This connection between "other" and "change" is normally obscured in English,
but the Latin-based word "alteration", which contains the Latin "alter"
("other"), makes it more evident. A similar case obtains for speakers of German:
_Veränderung_, which itself containers the word
"other"&mdash;_Anderes_&mdash;and literally means "to-other-ize". Yet another
similar case also obtains for Norwegian speakers with the word _forandre_, even
more than the German since "other" here is more obvious and recognizable. While
these connections in language are helpful, Hegel does not derive the connection
of "other" and "change" from words; the connection is a logical one, Houlgate
emphasizes, in the fact that the other, when considered by itself and made
explicit, "must be and constantly _become_ the other of itself" (Houlgate 2022,
182).

The idea of change is not complete, however, without the element of identity in
the process of `becoming-other`. `Becoming-other` signals that an `other` is not
primarily "other" vis-à-vis a `something`, but it is equally `other` with
regards to itself, such that is continuously _different_ from itself. This
emphasizes the element of difference, but there is also that of identity.
Precisely as the `other` becomes other to itself, it is no less, once again,
`other`. Change _does_ occur, indeed, the more it occurs the more the `other`
remains true to itself. "In the process of change the other thus _remains_ the
other that it is; and the more it changes and becomes other than itself, the
more it remains the other and so remains itself" (Houlgate 2022, 182).
Paradoxically, the more the `other` becomes what it is not, the more it remains
what it is. In terms of the process of change, then, the more alterations, the
more constancy is established.

As Houlgate points out, Hegel shows here that self-identity and change are not
in principle at odds with one another, as might be assumed. In fact,
self-identity is not only _preserved by_ the process of change, but _arises_
through it: "that in becoming other than itself, the other does not become
something radically new, but becomes another instance of what it already is,
what it is _before_ the change &ndash; another instance of being _other_"
(Houlgate 2022, 183). That it _arises_ becomes evident in the moment of identity
in the process of `becoming-other`.

Importantly, this moment of identity is not repeating what was already there but
_establishes_ the `other` to be what it is.

> ...in going over to this other, it only unites with itself (Hegel 2010,
> 92/21.108).

Houlgate carefully re-renders this passage from the German as:

```md
goes [...] together only with itself

geht [...] nur mit sich zusammen
```

While this may seem to repeat what is already known at this point, Houlgate
claims that it carries the argument forward. "The point to note is that the
other does not, and cannot, 'go together with itself' _before_ it changes; it
does so only _through_ changing into that which is still (in one respect)
itself" (Houlgate 2022, 183). Exactly this "going together with itself"
effectively designates a _self-relating_ being or `something`, leading the
logical development back to `something` from `other`. Finally, movement implies
that `becoming-other` into merely `other` is not the complete process of change,
for there is also `becoming-other` into a new `something`.

{/* Comment: what about the initial other prior to going together? Is this just a proxy? */}

It may appear as if the logical development hits a deadlock of ambiguity here.
When is something distinctly something versus when is it an other? How is other,
in othering, both the same old other _and_ something new? `Something` and
`other`, through change, develop into more granular determinations of
[`being-in-itself` and `being-for-other`](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/development#being-for-other-and-being-in-itself)
that aim to dispel exactly these ambiguities.

If Hegel is right, then change can be adequately conceptualized without
presupposing time. All that is required is the ideas of something and other, and
looking carefully at the logical implications that their relationship forms.
