## Nothing is in Itself Without the Other

Hegel's account of `something` and `other` shows that what something is in
itself is inextricably bound with its relation to others, such that there is no
thing that purely is related to itself without also being related to others and,
likewise, no thing is merely related to others without having some intrinsic
relation unto its own being _apart_ from others. This seems to be in stark
contrast to Kant, who famously distinguishes things in themselves from the way
the appear (or are experienced by human beings, i.e. from the way things in
themselves are _for_ us).

From Hegel's point of view, Kant's idea of a thing in itself that is entirely
distinct from how it appears for us&mdash;its "being-for-us"&mdash;is an
abstraction that, when examined carefully, proves to be logically incoherent.

However, Stephen Houlgate claims that Hegel subtly misunderstands Kant's concept
of the thing in itself, "Hegel takes Kant's concept of the 'thing-in-itself' to
refer, not only to what is objective rather than subjective, but to what things
are objectively, to what they really _are_ in themselves; that is, he conflates
Kant's thing in itself with _being_" (Houlgate 2022, 31). If Hegel's critique is
to have real merit, the misunderstanding needs to be clarified.

### Kant's Thing in Itself

Kant's transcendental philosophy aims to ascertain the limits of human
experience, and therefore, of knowledge. Truthful experience (or knowledge),
Kant claims, is minimally the synthesis of two heterogenous sources: intuitions
and concepts. The truthful conception of reality&mdash;as far as human beings
are ever able to experience it&mdash;entails a mediation of human mental
faculties (particularly the faculty of the understanding) with sensuous
intuitions. Effectively then, this counts as objectivity for Kant since it is
what makes possible any kind of determined _object_ at all.

> ...we have no concepts of the understanding and hence no elements for the
> cognition of things except insofar as an intuition can be given corresponding
> to these concepts, consequently that we can have cognition of no object as a
> thing in itself, but only insofar as it is an object of sensible intuition,
> i.e. as an appearance; from which follows the limitation of all even possible
> speculative cognition of reason to mere objects of **experience** (Kant 1998,
> 115/B XXVI).

Despite this criterion of experience and knowledge, reason&mdash;because it is
not limited by sensibility&mdash;is able to entertain thoughts about objects
that have an entirely different set of intuitions and categories, which would be
wholly inaccessible (and incomprehensible) to us. Kant calls this the noumenon:

> Thinking in itself, to be sure, is not a product of the senses, and to this
> extent is also not limited by them, but it is not on that account immediately
> of any independent and pure use, without assistance from sensibility, for it
> is in that case without an object. And one cannot call the noumenon such an
> **object** for this signifies precisely the problematic concept of an object
> for an entirely different intuition and an entirely different understanding
> than our own, which is thus a problem itself. The concept of the noumenon is
> therefore not the concept of an object, but rather the problem, unavoidably
> connected with the limitation of our sensibility, of whether there may not be
> objects entirely exempt from the intuition of our sensibility, a question that
> ... in the absence of a determinate concept (for which no category is
> serviceable) they also cannot be asserted as objects for our understanding
> (Kant 1998, 379-380/B344).

Now, Kant develops the idea of the thing in itself as an erroneous conception of
reality where, following the freedom of reason (noumenon), categories are
misapplied to intuitions or are thought to apply to things which really have no
sensuous intuitions. The thing in itself is an undetermined "object" that
pretends to be a real object of experience. Where actual experience is
concerned, by contrast, it is never looked after (see Kant 162/B45).

Kant thus traces the thing in itself as both a bug and a feature, as it were, of
reason's freedom from sensibility. If Kant is right, the thing in itself only
ever comes up indirectly in experience (via reason), not directly in experience
(via the understanding); that is, putting it figuratively, the thing in itself
is an afterthought that looks beyond the light of reality to unveil curtains the
mind itself had put there.

### What Hegel Gets Wrong

Following Stephen Houlgate's reading, there are two claims in Hegel's critique
of Kant:

1. Kant, as Hegel understood him, reduces the realm of experience to
   `appearance` because Kant thinks that the categories, along with the forms of
   intuition, are subjective. Our access to reality is not direct but mediated.
   According to Kant, then, the categories do not allow one to experience what
   things are in themselves (see Houlgate 2022, 31); that is, the categories do
   not bring to mind what in Hegel's eyes would be genuinely _objective_.
    1. Hegel criticizes this approach because the categories in Kant depend on
       the idea that what is subjective _cannot_ at the same time be objective.
       Kant's whole position here, therefore, rests on "an uncritical
       presupposition of the understanding" (Houlgate 2022, 31).
    2. What Hegel considers objective differs from Kant's conception. The former
       considers objectivity to be what things _really are_ in themselves,
       whereas the latter considers it to be what is _truthfully mediated_
       through the human cognition. Each of these could be distinguished as
       "Hegelian objectivity" and "Kantian objectivity".
2. Kant's thing in itself, in Hegel's view, is a real thing but "something alien
   and external to thinking" (Hegel 2010, 41/21.47). In Hegel's Kant, thought
   posits an unreachable object&mdash;a thing in itself&mdash;and thus remains
   enclosed within itself.
    1. But Hegel thinks that this object (thing in itself) is in fact not
       unreachable at all; not something that is beyond cognition. As Houlgate
       puts it, "Kant's unreachable 'thing' is not _beyond_ thought at all,
       because it is conceived by by means of the concepts and categories _of_
       thought. It is conceived as the 'negative' of determinate thought through
       the category negation, and as empty and featureless through the abstract
       concept of 'identity'" (Houlgate 2022, 31). Consequently, Kant's thing in
       itself is an abstraction produced by thought itself.

Hegel's second claim is the intended to be the actual criticism of Kant.
However, to return the criticism, Kant is well aware that the idea of a thing in
itself _is_ an abstraction produced by thought; he does not posit that there
actually is such a being that is merely in itself, but precisely aims to
diagnose it as a case where thought, or _reason_, errs.

Moreover, as Houlgate points out, "Kant does not start from the idea that there
is something out there we can't reach; he starts from the objects of experience
and examines what Allison calls their 'epistemic conditions', the conditions
under which alone they can be objects of experience" (Houlgate 2022, 32). The
objects of experience presuppose these conditions, the forms of intuition and
concepts, and all objects _for us_ can only ever be objects as seen from the
human finite points of view. Thus, Kant starts from _within_ experience, not by
transcending it.

Another thing to note is that the idea of `appearance` entails, or presupposes,
that which does _not_ appear. That is, given certain conditions under which
something does appear, it could be posited in itself _apart_ from those
conditions.

QUOTE ALLISON 2004, 56, see also 53-4.

Houlgate writes that the thing in itself is a necessary correlate to the concept
of `appearance` or phenomenon, and quotes, from Kant, "the understanding, when
it calls an object in relation mere phenomenon, simultaneously makes for itself,
beyond this relation, another representation of an _object in itself_" (Kant
1998, 360/B306; Houlgate 2022, 32).

WIP

The immediate issue with Hegel's first criticism here is that he conflates the
notions of objectivity between himself and Kant.

But Kant's thing in itself is not a real unreachable _thing_, but an abstraction
produced by thought itself.

TBA

Following Stephen Houlgate's reading, Kant has epistemic reasons for placing
things in themselves entirely beyond our experience (Houlgate 2022, 191). For
Kant, experience is conditioned by _a priori_ forms of intuition that are purely
subjective&mdash;or peculiar to _all_ human beings&mdash;which means those forms
cannot disclose what the objects of experience may be independently from
experience (see Kant 1998, 159/A26/B42). This leads to the idea that there is
something which only relates only to itself without relating to others. "In
Hegel's view", Houlgate writes, "Kant's _epistemic_ arguments are undermined by
the _onto-logical_ insight that what something is in itself is necessarily
present _in_ its relation to what is other" (Houlgate 2022, 191).

TBC - Kant might be right: his system precisely shows that there must be
being-for-other for being-in-itself in terms of validity for us. So Kant might
be closer to Hegel that the latter thinks.
