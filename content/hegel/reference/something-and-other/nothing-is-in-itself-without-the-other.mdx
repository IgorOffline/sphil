## Nothing is in Itself Without the Other

Hegel's account of `something` and `other` shows that what something is in
itself is inextricably bound with its relation to others, such that there is no
thing that purely is related to itself without also being related to others and,
likewise, no thing is merely related to others without having some intrinsic
relation unto its own being _apart_ from others. This seems to be in stark
contrast to Kant, who famously distinguishes things in themselves from the way
the appear (or are experienced by human beings, i.e. from the way things in
themselves are _for_ us).

From Hegel's point of view, Kant's idea of a thing in itself that is entirely
distinct from how it appears for us&mdash;its "being-for-us"&mdash;is an
abstraction that, when examined carefully, proves to be logically incoherent.

However, Stephen Houlgate claims that Hegel subtly misunderstands Kant's concept
of the thing in itself, "Hegel takes Kant's concept of the 'thing-in-itself' to
refer, not only to what is objective rather than subjective, but to what things
are objectively, to what they really _are_ in themselves; that is, he conflates
Kant's thing in itself with _being_" (Houlgate 2022, 31). If Hegel's critique is
to have real merit, the misunderstanding needs to be clarified.

## Kant's Thing in Itself

Kant's transcendental philosophy aims to ascertain the limits of human
experience, and therefore, of knowledge. Truthful experience (or knowledge),
Kant claims, is minimally the synthesis of two heterogenous sources: intuitions
and concepts. The truthful conception of reality&mdash;as far as human beings
are ever able to experience it&mdash;entails a mediation of human mental
faculties (particularly the faculty of the understanding) with sensuous
intuitions. Effectively then, this counts as objectivity for Kant since it is
what makes possible any kind of determined _object_ at all.

> ...we have no concepts of the understanding and hence no elements for the
> cognition of things except insofar as an intuition can be given corresponding
> to these concepts, consequently that we can have cognition of no object as a
> thing in itself, but only insofar as it is an object of sensible intuition,
> i.e. as an appearance; from which follows the limitation of all even possible
> speculative cognition of reason to mere objects of **experience** (Kant 1998,
> 115/B XXVI).

Despite this criterion of experience and knowledge, reason&mdash;because it is
not limited by sensibility&mdash;is able to entertain thoughts about objects
that have an entirely different set of intuitions and categories, which would be
wholly inaccessible (and incomprehensible) to us. Kant calls this the noumenon:

> Thinking in itself, to be sure, is not a product of the senses, and to this
> extent is also not limited by them, but it is not on that account immediately
> of any independent and pure use, without assistance from sensibility, for it
> is in that case without an object. And one cannot call the noumenon such an
> **object** for this signifies precisely the problematic concept of an object
> for an entirely different intuition and an entirely different understanding
> than our own, which is thus a problem itself. The concept of the noumenon is
> therefore not the concept of an object, but rather the problem, unavoidably
> connected with the limitation of our sensibility, of whether there may not be
> objects entirely exempt from the intuition of our sensibility, a question that
> ... in the absence of a determinate concept (for which no category is
> serviceable) they also cannot be asserted as objects for our understanding
> (Kant 1998, 379-380/B344).

Now, Kant develops the idea of the thing in itself as an erroneous conception of
reality where, following the freedom of reason (noumenon), categories are
misapplied to intuitions or are thought to apply to things which really have no
sensuous intuitions. The thing in itself is an undetermined "object" that
pretends to be a real object of experience. Where actual experience is
concerned, by contrast, it is never looked after (see Kant 162/B45).

Kant thus traces the thing in itself as both a bug and a feature, as it were, of
reason's freedom from sensibility. If Kant is right, the thing in itself only
ever comes up indirectly in experience (via reason), not directly in experience
(via the understanding); that is, putting it figuratively, the thing in itself
is an afterthought that looks beyond the light of reality to unveil curtains the
mind itself had put there.

## Revision I of Hegel's Critique of Kant's Thing in Itself

### What Hegel Gets Wrong

Following Stephen Houlgate's reading, there are two claims in Hegel's critique
of Kant:

1. Kant, as Hegel understood him, reduces the realm of experience to
   `appearance` because Kant thinks that the categories, along with the forms of
   intuition, are subjective. Our access to reality is not direct but mediated.
   According to Kant, then, the categories do not allow one to experience what
   things are in themselves (see Houlgate 2022, 31); that is, the categories do
   not bring to mind what in Hegel's eyes would be genuinely _objective_.
    1. Hegel criticizes this approach because the categories in Kant depend on
       the idea that what is subjective _cannot_ at the same time be objective.
       Kant's whole position here, therefore, rests on "an uncritical
       presupposition of the understanding" (Houlgate 2022, 31).
    2. What Hegel considers objective differs from Kant's conception. The former
       considers objectivity to be what things _really are_ in themselves,
       whereas the latter considers it to be what is _truthfully mediated_
       through the human cognition. Each of these could be distinguished as
       "Hegelian objectivity" and "Kantian objectivity".
2. Kant's thing in itself, in Hegel's view, is a real thing but "something alien
   and external to thinking" (Hegel 2010, 41/21.47). In Hegel's Kant, thought
   posits an unreachable object&mdash;a thing in itself&mdash;and thus remains
   enclosed within itself.
    1. But Hegel thinks that this object (thing in itself) is in fact not
       unreachable at all; not something that is beyond cognition. As Houlgate
       puts it, "Kant's unreachable 'thing' is not _beyond_ thought at all,
       because it is conceived by by means of the concepts and categories _of_
       thought. It is conceived as the 'negative' of determinate thought through
       the category negation, and as empty and featureless through the abstract
       concept of 'identity'" (Houlgate 2022, 31). Consequently, Kant's thing in
       itself is an abstraction produced by thought itself.

Hegel's second claim is the intended to be the actual criticism of Kant.
However, to return the criticism, Kant is well aware that the idea of a thing in
itself _is_ an abstraction produced by thought; he does not posit that there
actually is such a being that is merely in itself, but precisely aims to
diagnose it as a case where thought, or _reason_, errs.

Moreover, as Houlgate points out, "Kant does not start from the idea that there
is something out there we can't reach; he starts from the objects of experience
and examines what Allison calls their 'epistemic conditions', the conditions
under which alone they can be objects of experience" (Houlgate 2022, 32). The
objects of experience presuppose these conditions, the forms of intuition and
concepts, and all objects _for us_ can only ever be objects as seen from the
human finite points of view. Thus, Kant starts from _within_ experience, not by
transcending it.

Despite what Hegel maintains, Houlgate continues, "Kant's thing in itself is
thus not some indisputable _being_ just out of reach, but what is _thought_ to
be distinct from thought" (Houlgate 2022, 33). In this respect, Hegel's
criticism falls short since Kant is perfectly aware that the thing in itself
does not refer to a being in reality but is a _thought_ about a being in
reality, specifically, deprived of the sensuous intuitions, the conditions
necessary to form experience of _actual_ being in reality.

### What Hegel Gets Right

Despite the misunderstanding by Hegel on Kant's thing in itself, Houlgate still
thinks that Hegel's critique of Kant on the distinction between appearances and
things in themselves is not entirely undermined.

Kant, in Hegel's view, distinguished between a sphere of empirical objectivity
whose epistemic conditions are subjective&mdash;which formed the realm of
`appearances`&mdash;and the _objective_ character that things are thought to
have in their own right _apart_ from those conditions. "Kant himself might
describe the distinction in quite this way; but his explicit insistence that the
forms of intuition are subjective, and so do not belong to things themselves,
makes it inevitable that we equate the latter with things as they are thought to
be _objectively_ on their own" (Houlgate 2022, 33).

The main issue is that Kant separates thought and being, such that concepts, _by
themselves_, do not contain or relate to being. Only through sensuous intuitions
can concepts contain being. "Thought is essentially limited," for Kant, writes
Houlgate (quoting Hegel), "since, whatever concept we may consider 'existence
remains for him something utterly other than the concept" (Houlgate 2022, 34).
This is in contrast to Hegel, along with other philosophers such as Anselm,
Descartes and Spinoza, which all accept a unity of being and thought; "thought
by itself can think &ndash; that is, bring to mind &ndash; _being_ itself, be it
the being of divine substance, or of objects, or of the I. Kant, by contrast,
insists that thought and being are radically and definitively distinct"
(Houlgate 2022, 34-5).

The chief implication of Kant's thing in itself, as Hegel views it, is that it
reinforces the radical distinction between thought and being, which in turn
would solidify an ontological difference between `being-in-itself` and
`being-for-other`, that is, something that _only_ relates to others (thought,
following Kant's account) and something that relates only to itself (what the
thing in itself implies). Hegel does not think that being and thought are
entirely separated, but that there exists a unity, and that his account of the
categories `being-in-itself` and `being-for-other` prove that there is nothing,
much less thought and being, that exists only in relating to itself without an
relation to the other.

### Possible Problems: Not All Supersensible Referents are Alike

Supersensible referents is a class of Kantian terms that denote or gesture
toward what cannot appear in sensibility&mdash;such as the thing in itself, the
noumenon, the transcendental object, intelligible objects, object in itself and
other concepts that mark the limits of possible experience.

An important caveat is that Houlgate's reading relies on the fact that Kant's
thing in itself, transcendental object, object in itself, intelligible objects
and noumena all collapse into the same.[^1] This may not be case as there are
subtle differences between all these terms.

[^1]:
    "The concept [of the thing in itself] is produced, more specifically, to
    'limit the pretension of sensibility' and so coincides with the thought of
    the 'noumenon in the negative sense' ... Kant's concept also enables us to
    think of ourselves as affected by something non-sensible or 'intelligible'
    ... the thought of the 'thing' or 'object' 'in itself' coincides with that
    of the 'transcendental object, which is the cause of appearance (thus not
    itself appearance)'" (Houlgate 2022, 32, insertion added).

For example, here Kant distinguishes thing in itself from object in itself qua
transcendental object, the latter which acts effectively as cause whereas the
former does not have any relation to causality whatsoever:

> The understanding accordingly bounds sensibility without thereby expanding its
> own field, and in warning sensibility not to presume to reach for things in
> themselves but solely for appearances it thinks of an object in itself, but
> only as a transcendental object, which is the cause of appearance (thus not
> itself appearance) (Kant 1998, 381/B344).

Furthermore, here Kant distinguishes noumenon from intelligible objects, and
then adds that the idea of noumenon is meant to cancel out the understanding's
erroneous determining of things in themselves through the determination of
noumena.

> the concept of a _noumenon_ ... as a concept setting limits to sensibility.
> But in that case it is not a special intelligible object for our
> understanding; rather an understanding to which it would belong is itself a
> problem, namely, that of cognizing its object not discursively through
> categories but intuitively in a non-sensible intuition, the possibility of
> which we cannot in the least represent. Now in this way our understanding
> acquires a negative expansion, i.e., it is not limited by sensibility, but
> rather limits it by calling things in themselves (not considered as
> appearances) noumena (Kant 1998, 351/B312).

The thing in itself is therefore meant to be _avoided_ since it is an error.
Noumenon, on the other hand, is unavoidable since it serves to set limits to
reason, as the latter is not bound by sensibility.

Consequently, it is inaccurate to ascribe _any_ objective character to things in
themselves in Kant. Any notion of reality that is formed without sensuous
intuitions (including pure intuitions) cannot be classed as objective or
pertaining to objects; such a notion is precisely the overreach of reason which
it, through philosophy, must correct itself upon self-critical reflection.

## Revision II of Hegel's Critique of Kant's Thing in Itself

### The Thing in Itself Strikes Back

During the development of `being-in-itself` and `being-for-other`, Hegel makes
these remarks about the idea of the thing in itself:

> The thing-in-itself is the same as that absolute of which nothing is known
> except that in it all is one. What there is _in_ these things-in-themselves is
> therefore very well known; they are as such nothing but empty abstractions
> void of truth (Hegel 2010, 94/21.109).

That the thing in itself is an abstraction void of truth aligns well with Kant's
conception. However, Hegel continues:

> But in this Logic something better is understood by the _in-itself_ than an
> abstraction, namely, what something is in its concept; but this concept is in
> itself concrete: as concept, in principle conceptually graspable; and, as
> determined and as the connected whole of its determinations, inherently
> cognizable (Hegel 2010, 94/21.109).

Contra Kant, then, Hegel claims that the thing in itself qua being-in-itself
_is_ cognizable. But it is cognizable _because_ it is part of the conception of
`something`, which is necessarily connected to `being-for-other`. It is this
element of `being-for-other` that is the reason why `being-in-itself` is
accessible to thought in the first place.

This weakens Hegel's earlier assertion that Kant's thing in itself as "something
alien and external to thinking" (Hegel 2010, 41/21.47). While `being-in-itself`
proves to be a moment of `something`, it _does_ subsist momentarily in the
logical sequence as a distinction in its own right, and in that respect, it
seems indistinguishable from the thing in itself in its determination of
`something` that relates merely to itself (the thing in itself, obviously,
carries _also_ with it further epistemic connotations that are hereby omitted).

The issue is further complicated by the fact that Hegel later in the _Science of
Logic_ develops a category called the `thing in itself`: "The _thing in itself_
is the concrete existent as the _essential immediate_ that has resulted from the
sublated mediation" (Hegel 2010, 423/11.327). Here the thing in itself turns out
to be important in the logical development in determining the `property` of a
`thing`.

Hegel remarks that the real issue with Kant's thing in itself is that it is
supposed to be the abstraction of _all_ determination. "Once the thing-in-itself
has been presupposed in this way, all determination falls outside it into an
alien reflection to which it is indifferent" (Hegel 2010, 428/11.331). Kant's
shortcoming, in Hegel's eyes, is that he held "on to the _abstract
thing-in-itself_ as to an _ultimate determination_" (Hegel 2010, 428/11.332).
From this a series of wrongful conclusions about the I, consciousness and
reality, which, Hegel argues, demotes Kant's transcendental idealism to a crude
subjective idealism.

In sum, the thing in itself has a place in the logical development such that is
is not an entirely abstract category. In this respect Hegel does not take issue
with Kant _that there is_ a thing in itself. However, what Hegel now goes on to
criticize is the fixation of the thing in itself as purely existing
independently or "in opposing the determinateness and manifoldness of the
properties to the thing-in-itself" (Hegel 2010, 428/11.332). This weakens, if
not invalidates, Hegel's earlier critique of Kant of the thing in itself as
merely abstract or external to thought. His critique now targets its usage _as_
abstract or external, not only to thought, but to things in reality as well.

What reasons Hegel has for naming what amounts to the `thing in itself` in the
development of `concrete existence` is beyond the scope of this article, but it
does exacerbate navigating the already thorny terrain of his
[initial](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/nothing-is-in-itself-without-the-other#what-hegel-gets-wrong)
misreading.

### Yes We Kant

Hegel's _Logic_ shows that there must be `being-for-other` connected to
`being-in-itself`, such that there is no being that is merely related to itself
and therefore in principle entirely inaccessible. The implication of Kant's
philosophy, may be closer to this result than what Hegel claims.

In his _Critique of Pure Reason_, Kant is not, like Hegel, primarily interested
in the development of metaphysical categories but with the necessary conditions
for the possibility of experience. His project, then, is epistemic in nature,
rather than ontological. Nevertheless, Kant argues that any determined object
for us in experience must in principle have an outward being that is adaptable
to the human cognition through immediate, sensuous intuitions. If an object is
brought to mind bereft of these immediate givens, it is no real object at all
but a cognitive error.

Does Kant's system not show that there must, using Hegel's terms, be a
`being-for-other` in determining an actual `something`? The object of experience
_is_ manifest _objectively_&mdash;what the thing is in itself; its
`being-in-itself`&mdash;insofar as it appears, viz. there is a
`being-for-other`. Does this not validate Hegel's argument, but from an
epistemological standpoint? While Kant may fail to exhaust the determinations of
reason or insufficiently deduce the categories, as far as his project is
concerned, he does appear to show successfully that, practically, thought is in
error if it _only_ considers things in themselves _apart_ from how they may
possibly appear.

Hegel's metaphysics extends this epistemological tenet to be valid not only for
human cognition but for thought as such. Whether Hegel in his own project
succeeds or not is not the issue here, but the remarkable compatibility between
his and Kant's philosophies&mdash;despite their different methodologies&mdash;
on the incredible insight that nothing is in itself without the other.
