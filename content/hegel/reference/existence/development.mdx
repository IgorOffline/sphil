## The Development of Existence

### The Immediacy of Existence

> Existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and
> nothing. On account of this simplicity, it has the form of an _immediate_. Its
> mediation, the becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself, and existence
> therefore appears as a first from which the forward move is made. It is at
> first in the one-sided determination of _being_; the other determination which
> it contains, _nothing_, will likewise come up in it, in contrast to the first
> (Hegel 2010, 83/21.97).

While the category of existence is derived from
[becoming](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development)&mdash;and thus has
its justification therein&mdash;it is at first regarded in its immediacy. In
regards of this immediacy, existence is _simple_, and therefore the mediation
that brought it out is put behind it and it appears as "a first". In other
words, the thought of existence does not need to appeal to `becoming`, or its
mediation, in order _to be_. To illustrate: to point something out as _existing_
minimally determines a simple oneness of `being` and `nothing`, but does not, on
the face of it, point to any `becoming` or movement. There is just existence.
One simply exists.

### The Unity of Being and Non-being

The simplicity of `existence` is quickly complicated, as the apparent oneness of
`being` and `nothing` means that more is at work in `existence`, since these
categories
[cannot co-exist](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development#the-unity-of-being-and-nothing).
As Hegel goes on to write:

> As it follows upon becoming, existence is in general _being_ with a
> _non-being_, so that this non-being is taken up into simple unity with being.
> _Non-being_ thus taken up into being with the result that the concrete whole
> is in the form of being, of immediacy, constitutes _determinateness_ as such
> (Hegel 2010, 84/21.97).

Two things are key in this passage. First, `nothing` is recast as `non-being`
since the category `nothing` strictly _cannot_ be set in contrast with anything,
much less `being`, as it is _purely_ `nothing`. It thus cannot conceptually
co-exist with anything else. `Non-being` serves therefore as the part of the
oneness in which `being` vanishes into and emerges out of `nothing`. As
`non-being`, `nothing` is involved but only inasmuch as it is encapsulated by
`being`.

The second matter is that the unity of `being` and `non-being` that constitutes
`existence` is itself in the form of `being`.

    end
```

The fact that `being` and `non-being` are in the form of `being` ensures their
unity while also containing their difference. This unity clearly is concrete
since it both brings together as well as holds apart divergent elements. This is
exactly what establishes _determinateness_ for Hegel. But how does it achieve
that? What exactly is implied in this immediate form of determinateness?

### Determinateness as a Concrete Whole

> The _whole_ is likewise in the form or _determinateness_ of being, since in
> becoming being has likewise shown itself to be only a moment – something
> sublated, negatively determined. It is such, however, _for us_, _in our
> reflection_; not yet as _posited_ in it. What is posited, however, is the
> determinateness as such of existence, as is also expressed by the _da_ (or
> “there”) of the _Dasein_ (Hegel 2010, 84/21.97).

This passage is tricky since since it appears that Hegel looks ahead from the
current situation. In _our_ reflection&mdash;as concrete thinkers with more
concepts available to us than the logic at hand&mdash;is it noted that the
whole, or the unity, of `being` and `non-being` must equally be a _determined
being_, no less than its constituent moments. Though this is not evident in the
immanent development.

Following this passage, Hegel appears to
[insert a comment](/articles/hegel/reference/_annotations/textual#inline-comments)
about the nature of positing, which serves to show that the distinction just
made was for educational purposes rather than demonstrating anything about the
development.

> Existence corresponds to being in the preceding sphere. But being is the
> indeterminate; there are no determinations that therefore transpire in it. But
> existence is determinate being, something concrete; consequently, several
> determinations, several distinct relations of its moments, immediately emerge
> in it (Hegel 2010, 84/21.98).

Hegel ends this section by stating that `existence` corresponds to `being` but
that while the latter was indeterminate, the former is, by contrast,
determinate. Two more key things to note in this passage is the meaning of
"determinations transpiring" in a category and the idea that _several_
determinations and distinctions _immediately_ emerge. From the latter,
`existence` is regarded as something immediately complex, as was already
understood from the preceding despite its simplicity. But exactly
this&mdash;which relates to the former matter about "transpiring"&mdash;reveals
the glimmers, as it were, of a movement amidst this static determinacy.

### Textual Note

The German _Dasein_, which Hegel uses for the category in question, has been
translated into `existence` by George Di Giovanni. It has also been translated
into `determinate being` or `a being`. While these other translations are not
incorrect, there are some additional benefits with using `existence`. It is both
more precise and is linguistically more natural. As Di Giovanni writes, "All
_Dasein_ is 'determinate being,' but not all 'determinate being' is merely
_Dasein_. Moreover, using 'determinate being' makes the task of translating such
derivatives as _seiend_, _Seiendes_, and _Daseiendes_, practically impossible or
at least very cumbersome" (Hegel 2010, lxviii).
