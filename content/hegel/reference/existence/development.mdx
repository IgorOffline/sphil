## The Development of Existence

### Textual Note

The German _Dasein_, which Hegel uses for the category in question, has been
translated into `existence` by George Di Giovanni. It has also been translated
into `determinate being` or `a being`. While these other translations are not
incorrect, there are some additional benefits with using `existence`. It is both
more precise and is linguistically more natural. As Di Giovanni writes, "All
_Dasein_ is 'determinate being,' but not all 'determinate being' is merely
_Dasein_. Moreover, using 'determinate being' makes the task of translating such
derivatives as _seiend_, _Seiendes_, and _Daseiendes_, practically impossible or
at least very cumbersome" (Hegel 2010, lxviii).

### The Immediacy of Existence

While the category of existence is derived from
[becoming](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development)&mdash;and thus has
its justification therein&mdash;it is at first regarded in its immediacy. In
regards of this immediacy, existence is _simple_, and therefore the mediation
that brought it out is put behind it and it appears as "a first". In other
words, the thought of existence does not need to appeal to `becoming`, or its
mediation, in order _to be_. To illustrate: to point something out as _existing_
minimally determines a simple oneness of `being` and `nothing`.

This simple oneness is quickly complicated, however. The apparent oneness of
`being` and `nothing` means that more is at work in `existence`, since these
categories
[cannot co-exist](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development#the-unity-of-being-and-nothing).
