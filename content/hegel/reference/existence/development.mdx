## The Development of Existence

### Textual Note

The German _Dasein_, which Hegel uses for the category in question, has been
translated into `existence` by George Di Giovanni. It has also been translated
into `determinate being` or `a being`. While these other translations are not
incorrect, there are some additional benefits with using `existence`. It is both
more precise and is linguistically more natural. As Di Giovanni writes, "All
_Dasein_ is 'determinate being,' but not all 'determinate being' is merely
_Dasein_. Moreover, using 'determinate being' makes the task of translating such
derivatives as _seiend_, _Seiendes_, and _Daseiendes_, practically impossible or
at least very cumbersome" (Hegel 2010, lxviii).
