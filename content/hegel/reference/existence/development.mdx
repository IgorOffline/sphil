## The Development of Existence

### Textual Note

The German _Dasein_, which Hegel uses for the category in question, has been
translated into `existence` by George Di Giovanni. It has also been translated
into `determinate being` or `a being`. While these other translations are not
incorrect, there are some additional benefits with using `existence`. It is both
more precise and is linguistically more natural. As Di Giovanni writes, "All
_Dasein_ is 'determinate being,' but not all 'determinate being' is merely
_Dasein_. Moreover, using 'determinate being' makes the task of translating such
derivatives as _seiend_, _Seiendes_, and _Daseiendes_, practically impossible or
at least very cumbersome" (Hegel 2010, lxviii).

### The Immediacy of Existence

While the category of existence is derived from
[becoming](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development)&mdash;and thus has
its justification therein&mdash;it is at first regarded in its immediacy. In
regards of this immediacy, existence is _simple_, and therefore the mediation
that brought it out is put behind it and it appears as "a first". In other
words, the thought of existence does not need to appeal to `becoming`, or its
mediation, in order _to be_. To illustrate: to point something out as _existing_
minimally determines a simple oneness of `being` and `nothing`, but does not, on
the face of it, point to any `becoming` or movement.

### The Unity of Being and Non-being

The simplicity of `existence` is quickly complicated, as the apparent oneness of
`being` and `nothing` means that more is at work in `existence`, since these
categories
[cannot co-exist](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development#the-unity-of-being-and-nothing).
As Hegel goes on to write:

> As it follows upon becoming, existence is in general _being_ with a
> _non-being_, so that this non-being is taken up into simple unity with being.
> _Non-being_ thus taken up into being with the result that the concrete whole
> is in the form of being, of immediacy, constitutes _determinateness_ as such
> (Hegel 2010, 84/21.97).

Two things are key in this passage. First, `nothing` is recast as `non-being`
since the category `nothing` strictly _cannot_ be set in contrast with anything,
much less `being`, as it is _purely_ `nothing`. It thus cannot conceptually
co-exist with anything else. `Non-being` serves therefore as the part of the
oneness in which `being` vanishes into and emerges out of `nothing`. As
`non-being`, `nothing` is involved but only inasmuch as it is encapsulated by
`being`.

The second matter is that the unity of `being` and `non-being` that constitutes
`existence` is itself in the form of `being`.

    end
```

The fact that `being` and `non-being` are in the form of `being` ensures their
unity while also containing their difference. This unity clearly is concrete
since it both brings together as well as holds apart divergent elements. This is
exactly what establishes _determinateness_ for Hegel. But how does it achieve
that? What exactly is implied in this immediate form of determinateness?
