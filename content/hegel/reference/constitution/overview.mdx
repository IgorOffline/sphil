## Overview of Constitution

`Constitution` (_Beschaffenheit_) designates the way a thing is determined in
relation to another &ndash; it is the external side of a thing's determinacy,
how it appears and behaves in a field of relations. Unlike `determination`,
which expresses the inner character of a thing as something in itself,
`constitution` reveals how this inner character necessarily expresses itself
outwardly, becoming intelligible only through its relations to others.

Hegel shows how a thing's constitution is not something added from the outside;
it is the necessary way in which its `being-in-itself` is also a
`being-for-other`. This relational character implies that things are not closed,
self-contained units, but open and mediated processes. `Constitution` therefore
marks a critical turning point in Hegel's logic, where the opposition between
what a thing intrinsically is and its relation to others begins to break down.
