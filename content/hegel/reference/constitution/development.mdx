## The Development of Constitution

### Externally Determined

The category `constitution` (_Beschaffenheit_) is made explicit in the
development of
[`determination`](/articles/hegel/reference/determination/development) and
concerns the outward being or `being-for-other` that falls beyond the intrinsic
being&mdash;`being-in-itself`&mdash;of
[`something`](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development). Basically, it
concerns that part of the relationship that something has with others that it
does not govern or form part of its `determination`.

> Constituted in this or that way, the something is caught up in external
> influences and in external relationships. This external connection on which
> the constitution depends, and the being determined through an other, appear as
> something accidental. But it is the quality of the something to be given over
> to this externality and to have a _constitution_ (Hegel 2010, 96/21.111).

Hegel makes clear that the fact that `something` has external relationships
beyond its control&mdash;which appear for that reason as accidents&mdash;is _not
itself_ an accident or something externally determined. It belongs to the nature
of `something` to determine itself through relations with others, but that this
is a double-edged sword, so to speak, since it necessarily involves what is
determined by the other. For that reason, if `something` has `determination`, it
must therefore also be externally `constituted`.

### Change in Constitution

> In so far as something alters, the alteration falls on the side of its
> constitution; the latter is that _in the something_ which becomes an other.
> The something itself preserves itself in the alteration; the latter affects
> only this unstable surface of the something's otherness, not its determination
> (Hegel 2010, 96/21.112).

When `something` changes, according to Hegel, the change does not encompass the
entire thing. If that were so, it would simply _be_ another thing and
effectively no change would really take place. Instead, a reference to
`something` must be maintained for change to be meaningful. But, conversely, a
reference to what is utterly `other` to `something` must likewise be made, since
there is a new element that is at play which differentiates one state of
`something` to another.

Hegel claims that this element of change is contained under the `constitution`
of the thing. For example, Arnold is in bad shape but decides to do something
about it and goes to the gym regularly to become fit. In this example, whether
in bad or good shape, Arnold is still the same person (the same `something`),
however, something fundamental about Arnold really has changed; he demonstrated
his `determination` to be healthy by exercising (or, conversely, taking his
health for granted by not exercising). Being in good or bad shape are rather
themselves contingent, as neither intrinsically belong to Arnold as such insofar
as Arnold is simply to be. These therefore form part of Arnold's `constitution`
and is seen how his `determination` is mediated through it.

### Being-in-the-something

Hegel further develops the relation and difference between `constitution` and
`determination`, starting from how the latter is _indifferent_ to the former.

> Determination and constitution are thus distinct from each other; something,
> according to its determination, is indifferent to its constitution. But that
> which the something has _in it_ is the middle term of this syllogism
> connecting the two, determination and constitution. Or, rather, the
> _being-in-the-something_ showed itself to fall apart into these two extremes
> (Hegel 2010, 96/21.112).

Recall that `something` has a outward being or a being that is related to others
(`being-for-other`), and that this outward being is further subdivided into, on
the one hand, what is beholden to the `something` (its `being-in-itself`) in
question , and on the other hand, what is externally determined by `other`.
These two outwardly related forms of being are respectively classed as
`determination` and `constitution`. Now, what connects the `determination` and
`constitution`? Hegel claims it is what the `something` has "in it" that
connects these two and that is provisionally called `being-in-the-something`.
But what really is such a being if not _another_ `something`?

At first, Hegel defines this `being-in-the-something` generically as
"determinateness as such" (_Bestimmtheit als solche_):

> The simple middle term is determinateness as such; its identity belongs to
> determination just as well as to constitution (Hegel 2010, 96-7/21.112).

`Determinateness`, which presumably means it is minimally a form `quality`, is
that in which both `determination` and `constitution` partake.

Hegel goes on to elaborate on the connection:

> The connection, upon closer consideration, is this: in so far as that which
> something is _in itself_ is also _in it_, the something is affected with
> being-for-other; determination is therefore open, as such, to the relation
> with other (Hegel 2010, 97/21.112).

By way of simple inference, if `determination` and `constitution` are connected
by a point of identity, then the thing's `determination` not only points outward
_from_ the thing itself, but that external reality also points inward into the
thing itself. The very `determination` of a thing is exposed to being affected
by the other.

This implication found in `determination` that it is open to be affected
externally aligns well with everyday intuitions about how things and people grow
and develop. It is ingrained in everyday thinking that what something is or who
someone is, depends in large part of outside influences. Indeed, where one is
born proves to `constitute` either a formidable advantage or grave disadvantage.
Hegel claims to prove this to be the case, however, _ontologically_, such that
it forms not only part of historically lived, concrete reality but _any_ being's
`determination`&mdash;_including_ metaphysical categories, as well as
fundamental qualities of natural or social reality. If Hegel is right, there is
no `determination` that is _merely_ the expression of a thing's intrinsic being;
it is _also_ the expression of all the things that that thing comes into contact
with.

### Alteration of Determination and Constitution

> Determinateness is at the same time moment, but it contains at the same time
> the qualitative distinction of being different from _being-in-itself_, of
> being the negative of the something, another existence. This determinateness
> which thus holds the other in itself, united with the _being-in-itself_,
> introduces otherness in the latter or in determination, and determination is
> thereby reduced to constitution (Hegel 2010, 97/21.112).

`Determinateness` connects `determination` and `constitution`, and forms a
moment of both while both also form a moment of it. Through this bridge,
`determination` is expressed in (or "reduced" to) `constitution`. Or, put
differently, through `determinateness` the element of `constitution` is no
longer merely outside `determination` but right there _in it_. This begins to
show how not only `determination` and `constitution` are connected, but also how
one _turns_ into the other.

> Conversely, the being-for-other, isolated as constitution and posited on its
> own, is in it the same as what the other as such is, the other in it, that is,
> the other of itself; but it consequently is _self-referring_ existence, thus
> being-in-itself with a determinateness, therefore determination (Hegel 2010,
> 97/21.112).

`Constitution` is explicitly `being-for-other` _on its own_, such that while it
expresses the `being-for-other` _of the other_, it nevertheless has a
`being-in-itself` through its unity of being the `other`, which in turn is
distinct from this other being _in it_. In this regard, the constituted being
has its _own_ `determination` that distinguishes it from the `determination` of
the other, and this distinguishing establishes a `determinateness`.

This tighter coupling between the categories in questions implies that there is
nothing in `something` that is immune to being changed. _Everything_ in the
`something` is open to be determined through another. As Hegel confirms:
"constitution belongs to that which something is in itself: something alters
along with its constitution" (Hegel 2010, 97/21.112).

Change is no longer viewed as merely external to `something`, but cut through
into its intrinsic being. To illustrate, the constitution of a nation may be
regarded as the source of its determination, but times may change and events may
unfold whereby the constitution becomes altered by the spirit of the times,
which sets the groundwork for _another_ determination to evolve from it in the
future. Where in this is the real identity of the nation, or the real identity
of the thing in question, if neither determination nor constitution really hold
the primacy but form, rather, a dance of equilibrium?

### Sublation of Determination and Constitution

If `determination` and `constitution` logically lead into one another, neither
is independent from the other and they both form moments of a new context.
However, there is presently no context that specifically contains these, so the
logic reverts back to the minimal form of determinacy, which is `existence`. In
other words, the logic of `something` has proved to have a `determination` _and_
`constitution`, but each of these terms bleed into one another, as it were, such
that there is no true `determination` that does not also have a `constitution`
and vice versa, which effectively means that these terms fail to adequately
express the intrinsic vis-Ã -vis extrinsic being of `something`.

> The transition of determination and constitution into each other is at first
> the sublation of their distinction, and existence or something in general is
> thereby posited; moreover, since this something in general results from a
> distinction that also includes qualitative otherness within it, there are two
> somethings (Hegel 2010, 97/21.113).

The development falls back into `existence`&mdash;the minimally determinate
being&mdash;which re-develops back to `something`. However, in contrast to the
[first](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development) development of
`something`&mdash;which also saw the development of the _mediated_ `something`
as the `other`&mdash;the `something` that emerges here carries with it the
development of
[`something` and `other`](/articles/hegel/reference/something-and-other/development)
and `determination` and `constitution`, such that the `other` is no longer
viewed as _separate_ from the `something` but as vital to the determination of
its intrinsic being. In other words, negation is now immanent to the nature of
being `something`. As Hegel elaborates:

> But these are, with respect to each other, not just others in general, so that
> this negation would still be abstract and would occur only in the comparison
> of the two; rather the negation now is _immanent_ to the somethings (Hegel
> 2010, 97/21.113).

Hegel then distinguishes `something` and `other` as merely existing in contrast
to their _affirmation_. `Something` is _affirmed_ when it has returned to itself
through the mediation of the otherness that is latent in it. So one could say
that a thing is more real when it is understood to be distinguished through the
process in which it inheres. The process, or relation to the `other`, is
logically bound to the reality of the thing, which has previously been expressed
as its `constitution` and `determination`. Affirmation, then, here seems to be a
fuller development of `quality`, `reality` and `negation`, since it exhibits the
`something` as being determinate _through the negation_, not as merely apart
from it, but within.

> As existing, they are indifferent to each other, but this, their affirmation,
> is no longer immediate: each refers itself to itself _through the
> intermediary_ of the sublation of the otherness which in determination is
> reflected into the in-itselfness (Hegel 2010, 97/21.113).

The "in-itselfness" or `being-in-itself` is forwarded by `determination`, which
in turn is connected through `determinateness` to `constitution`, such that the
inner is connected to the outer in a two-fold manner; the outer has a being of
its own whilst also enjoying a being within the inner, which forms a moment of
the inner as such. In this way, the `something` refers itself to itself, as
Hegel claims, by rendering explicit how the outer is already a part of the inner
and the inner the outer.

### The Other Within

Hegel continues to focus on the moment of how the outer being or
`being-for-other` is within `something`, serving as its affirmation, whilst also
retaining an independent being from it.

> Something behaves in this way in relation to the other _through itself_; since
> otherness is posited in it as its own moment, its in-itselfness holds negation
> in itself, and it now has its affirmative existence through its intermediary
> alone. But the other is also qualitatively distinguished from this affirmative
> existence and is thus posited outside the something (Hegel 2010, 97-8/21.113).

But the interdependence of `something` and `other` means that each really is
what it is through the other. As Hegel confirms: "The negation of its other is
only the quality of the something, for it is in this sublation of its other that
it is something. The other, for its part, truly confronts an existence only with
this sublation" (Hegel 2010, 98/21.113). It is through the other's sublation
that each comes to be what they are.

Hegel then claims that from the interdependence of `something` and `other` it
follows that each category has transitioned into the other.

> ...since the two are in fact inherently joined together, that is, according to
> their concept, their connectedness consists in this, that existence _has
> passed over_ into otherness, something into other; that something is just as
> much an other as the other is (Hegel 2010, 98/21.113).

With this transition in mind, Hegel continues to point out that each category is
the ceasing of the being of an other in it. In other words, once `something` has
transitioned into being the `other`, there is strictly nothing of `something`
left; and once `other` has transitioned to be `something`, the `other` ceases
entirely to be. As Hegel asserts:

> Now in so far as the in-itselfness is the non-being of the otherness that is
> contained in it but is at the same time also distinct as existent, something
> is itself negation, _the ceasing to be of an other in it_; it is posited as
> behaving negatively in relation to the other and in so doing preserving itself
> (Hegel 2010, 98/21.113).

To sum up, through the development of `determination` and `constitution` it is
seen how `being-for-other` and `being-in-itself` are more closely intertwined,
which in turn redefined the relationship of `something` and `other`: the latter
are no longer merely isolated and cleanly separable but interdependent whereby
each exist inasmuch as the other has sublated itself and made itself a moment of
the other's self-reference. Further, this self-reference actively depends not
only on the other having made itself a moment but also that that moment is
_negated_ by the thing in question. Through this it has been made explicit,
then, that for `something` to be, it is necessary that it refers to `other` as a
moment it excludes from its intrinsic being.

### Aliqulux Obscurans

> This other, the in-itselfness of the something as negation of the negation, is
> the something's _being-in-itself_, and this sublation is as simple negation at
> the same time _in it_, namely, as its negation of the other something external
> to it (Hegel 2010, 98/21.113).

Hegel repeats that the `other` is connected to the intrinsic being
(`being-in-itself`) of `something`, but that exactly this feature is negated,
such that the connection `something` has to this `other` (on which it depends)
is excluded. Notice, however, that exclusion here does not mean complete
severance or elimination of that connection; logically the connection is still
there but it is made implicit rather than explicit.

This understanding of how `something` is made implicit retroactively establishes
how it was possible that `something` and `other` were at one point indeed viewed
as separate and interchangeable, owing in large part to the _immediacy_ of their
determination, which it is now understood follows from the negation of the
relation to the `other`. The `other` is vital to the being of `something`, but
in _being_ `something`, the latter's immediacy has obscured the mediation on
which it depends. Putting it figuratively, it is, paradoxically, the light of
`something's` being that darkens the relations to its `other`.

### Reaching the Limit

> It is one determinateness of the two somethings that, on the one hand, as
> negation of the negation, is identical with the in-itselfness of the
> somethings, and also, on the other hand, since these negations are to each
> other as other somethings, joins them together of their own accord and, since
> each negation negates the other, equally separates them (Hegel 2010,
> 98/21.113).

Previously it was seen how `determination` and `constitution` are connected
through `determinateness`. It was then shown how the
`determination-constitution` pair turn into one another, which in turn deepened
the connection that `something` has to its `other`. If this development is taken
within the context of `determinateness`, then it serves to both join the two
`somethings` and separate them. With these additional steps, Hegel appears to
recast `determinateness` as `limit`.

`Limit` thus already comes built in with the understanding of how the `other` is
intertwined with the `something`, how each of these render themselves as a
moment of the other and, finally, how each is established in the negation of the
moment of the `other` within it. Additionally, `limit` is not the mere negation
of the `other` within `something`, but also the `negation of negation` (a
`something`), and as such expands with its own qualitative being between the two
`somethings`. This last establishes the `limit` with its own internal being.
