## The Development of Constitution

### Externally Determined

The category `constitution` (_Beschaffenheit_) is made explicit in the
development of
[`determination`](/articles/hegel/reference/determination/development) and
concerns the outward being or `being-for-other` that falls beyond the intrinsic
being&mdash;`being-in-itself`&mdash;of
[`something`](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development). Basically, it
concerns that part of the relationship that something has with others that it
does not govern or form part of its `determination`.

> Constituted in this or that way, the something is caught up in external
> influences and in external relationships. This external connection on which
> the constitution depends, and the being determined through an other, appear as
> something accidental. But it is the quality of the something to be given over
> to this externality and to have a _constitution_ (Hegel 2010, 96/21.111).

Hegel makes clear that the fact that `something` has external relationships
beyond its control&mdash;which appear for that reason as accidents&mdash;is _not
itself_ an accident or something externally determined. It belongs to the nature
of `something` to determine itself through relations with others, but that this
is a double-edged sword, so to speak, since it necessarily involves what is
determined by the other. For that reason, if `something` has `determination`, it
must therefore also be externally `constituted`.

## Change in Constitution

> In so far as something alters, the alteration falls on the side of its
> constitution; the latter is that _in the something_ which becomes an other.
> The something itself preserves itself in the alteration; the latter affects
> only this unstable surface of the something's otherness, not its determination
> (Hegel 2010, 96/21.112).

When `something` changes, according to Hegel, the change does not encompass the
entire thing. If that were so, it would simply _be_ another thing and
effectively no change would really take place. Instead, a reference to
`something` must be maintained for change to be meaningful. But, conversely, a
reference to what is utterly `other` to `something` must likewise be made, since
there is a new element that is at play which differentiates one state of
`something` to another.

Hegel claims that this element of change is contained under the `constitution`
of the thing. For example, Arnold is in bad shape but decides to do something
about it and goes to the gym regularly to become fit. In this example, whether
in bad or good shape, Arnold is still the same person (the same `something`),
however, something fundamental about Arnold really has changed; he demonstrated
his `determination` to be healthy by exercising (or, conversely, taking his
health for granted by not exercising). Being in good or bad shape are rather
themselves contingent, as neither intrinsically belong to Arnold as such insofar
as Arnold is simply to be. These therefore form part of Arnold's `constitution`
and is seen how his `determination` is mediated through it.

## Being-in-the-something

Hegel further develops the relation and difference between `constitution` and
`determination`, starting from how the latter is _indifferent_ to the former.

> Determination and constitution are thus distinct from each other; something,
> according to its determination, is indifferent to its constitution. But that
> which the something has _in it_ is the middle term of this syllogism
> connecting the two, determination and constitution. Or, rather, the
> _being-in-the-something_ showed itself to fall apart into these two extremes
> (Hegel 2010, 96/21.112).

Recall that `something` has a outward being or a being that is related to others
(`being-for-other`), and that this outward being is further subdivided into, on
the one hand, what is beholden to the `something` (its `being-in-itself`) in
question , and on the other hand, what is externally determined by `other`.
These two outwardly related forms of being are respectively classed as
`determination` and `constitution`. Now, what connects the `determination` and
`constitution`? Hegel claims it is what the `something` has "in it" that
connects these two and that is provisionally called `being-in-the-something`.
But what really is such a being if not _another_ `something`?

At first, Hegel defines this `being-in-the-something` generically as
"determinateness as such" (_Bestimmtheit als solche_):

> The simple middle term is determinateness as such; its identity belongs to
> determination just as well as to constitution (Hegel 2010, 96-7/21.112).

`Determinateness`, which presumably means it is minimally a form `quality`, is
that in which both `determination` and `constitution` partake.

Hegel goes on to elaborate on the connection:

> The connection, upon closer consideration, is this: in so far as that which
> something is _in itself_ is also _in it_, the something is affected with
> being-for-other; determination is therefore open, as such, to the relation
> with other (Hegel 2010, 97/21.112).

By way of simple inference, if `determination` and `constitution` are connected
by a point of identity, then the thing's `determination` not only points outward
_from_ the thing itself, but that external reality also points inward into the
thing itself. The very `determination` of a thing is exposed to being affected
by the other.

// TODO Move paragraph below to later?

This implication found in `determination` that it is open to be affected
externally aligns well with everyday intuitions about how things and people grow
and develop. It is ingrained in everyday thinking that what something is or who
someone is, depends in large part of outside influences. Indeed, where one is
born proves to `constitute` either a formidable advantage or grave disadvantage.
Hegel claims to prove this to be the case, however, _ontologically_, such that
it forms not only part of historically lived, concrete reality but _any_ being's
`determination`&mdash;_including_ metaphysical categories, as well as
fundamental qualities of natural or social reality. If Hegel is right, there is
no `determination` that is _merely_ the expression of a thing's intrinsic being;
it is _also_ the expression of all the things that that thing comes into contact
with.

### Alteration of Determination and Constitution

> Determinateness is at the same time moment, but it contains at the same time
> the qualitative distinction of being different from _being-in-itself_, of
> being the negative of the something, another existence. This determinateness
> which thus holds the other in itself, united with the _being-in-itself_,

`Determinateness` connects `determination` and `constitution`, and forms a
moment of both while both also form a moment of it. Through this bridge,
`determination` is expressed in (or "reduced" to) `constitution`. Or, put
differently, through `determinateness` the element of `constitution` is no
longer merely outside `determination` but right there _in it_. This begins to
show how not only `determination` and `constitution` are connected, but also how
one _turns_ into the other.

> Conversely, the being-for-other, isolated as constitution and posited on its
> own, is in it the same as what the other as such is, the other in it, that is,
> the other of itself; but it consequently is _self-referring_ existence, thus
> being-in-itself with a determinateness, therefore determination (Hegel 2010,
> 97/21.112).

`Constitution` is explicitly `being-for-other` _on its own_, such that while it
expresses the `being-for-other` _of the other_, it nevertheless has a
`being-in-itself` through its unity of being the `other`, which in turn is
distinct from this other being _in it_. In this regard, the constituted being
has its _own_ `determination` that distinguishes it from the `determination` of
the other, and this distinguishing establishes a `determinateness`.

This tighter coupling between the categories in questions implies that there is
nothing in `something` that is immune to being changed. _Everything_ in the
`something` is open to be determined through another. As Hegel confirms:
"constitution belongs to that which something is in itself: something alters
along with its constitution" (Hegel 2010, 97/21.112).

Change is no longer viewed as merely external to `something`, but cut through
into its intrinsic being. To illustrate, the constitution of a nation may be
regarded as the source of its determination, but times may change and events may
unfold whereby the constitution becomes altered by the spirit of the times,
which sets the groundwork for _another_ determination to evolve from it in the
future. Where in this is the real identity of the nation, or the real identity
of the thing in question, if neither determination nor constitution really hold
the primacy but form, rather, a dance of equilibrium?
