## The Development of Constitution

### Externally Determined

The category `constitution` (_Beschaffenheit_) is made explicit in the
development of
[`determination`](/articles/hegel/reference/determination/development) and
concerns the outward being or `being-for-other` that falls beyond the intrinsic
being&mdash;`being-in-itself`&mdash;of
[`something`](/articles/hegel/reference/something/development). Basically, it
concerns that part of the relationship that something has with others that it
does not govern or form part of its `determination`.

> Constituted in this or that way, the something is caught up in external

Hegel makes clear that the fact that `something` has external relationships
beyond its control&mdash;which appear for that reason as accidents&mdash;is _not
itself_ an accident or something externally determined. It belongs to the nature
of `something` to determine itself through relations with others, but that this
is a double-edged sword, so to speak, since it necessarily involves what is
determined by the other. For that reason, if `something` has `determination`, it
must therefore also be externally `constituted`.

## Change in Constitution

> The something itself preserves itself in the alteration; the latter affects

When `something` changes, according to Hegel, the change does not encompass the
entire thing. If that were so, it would simply _be_ another thing and
effectively no change would really take place. Instead, a reference to
`something` must be maintained for change to be meaningful. But, conversely, a
reference to what is utterly `other` to `something` must likewise be made, since
there is a new element that is at play which differentiates one state of
`something` to another.

Hegel claims that this element of change is contained under the `constitution`
of the thing. For example, Arnold is in bad shape but decides to do something
about it and goes to the gym regularly to become fit. In this example, whether
in bad or good shape, Arnold is still the same person (the same `something`),
however, something fundamental about Arnold really has changed; he demonstrated
his `determination` to be healthy by exercising (or, conversely, taking his
health for granted by not exercising). Being in good or bad shape are rather
themselves contingent, as neither intrinsically belong to Arnold as such insofar
as Arnold is simply to be. These therefore form part of Arnold's `constitution`
and is seen how his `determination` is mediated through it.
