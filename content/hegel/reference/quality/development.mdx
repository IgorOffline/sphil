When `existence` is regarded in its immediacy, the unity of `being` and
`non-being` is understood in a simple oneness. However, this simple immediacy is
next undermined by the fact that existence is not merely immediate but is
specifically _existing_&mdash;phrased somewhat terse by Hegel as "the extent
that existence is existent". The transition here is instant: going from the
element of immediacy (`being`) to its vanishing (`non-being`). However, in
contrast to `pure being`, `existence` as a concept does not cease at its
`non-being`. In fact, if Hegel is right, that is where it _begins_.

Hegel warns that `being` is not to be understood as a universal with
determinateness as a particular, which could suggest that being is a generic
genus of which determinateness is a particular species. This would suggest that
there could be `being` in some general form, which sometimes is counted as
determined and sometimes not. No further speculations about the nature of
undetermined `being` is necessary, since that was scrutinized
[earlier in the _Logic_](/articles/hegel/reference/being/development) and proved
to be determinate.

Determinateness, or what a being specifically is, cannot be set apart from
`being`. The implication discovered
[previously](/articles/hegel/reference/becoming/development) is that `being` and
`non-being` are logically intertwined, yet it is in the former sublating itself
that it becomes evident _how_ being is _specifically_, namely, what it is _not_.
The case in point here is simply that `being` is _not_ `nothing`&mdash;in order
to conceptualize this, `nothing` must be connected to `being`, however, not as
sheer `nothing` but as the point where `being` ceases or where `being` is
`non-being`.
