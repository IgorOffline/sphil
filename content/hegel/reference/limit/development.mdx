## The Development of Limit

### Exclusion

The category `limit` (_Grenze_) follows from the development of
[`constitution`](/articles/hegel/reference/constitution/development), which in
turn follows from
[`determination`](/articles/hegel/reference/determination/development).
Initially, `limit` is defined as that which excludes any outward relations
`something` has to an `other`.

> _Being-for-other_ is indeterminate, affirmative association of something with
> its other; in limit the _non-being-for-other_ is emphasized, the qualitative
> negation of the other, which is thereby kept out of the something that is
> reflected into itself (Hegel 2010, 98/21.114).

`Limit` serves to _exclude_ the relation (association) `something` has with
`others`. Notice that `negation` will not eliminate the outward relation but
suppress it and shift the emphasis on the inward or intrinsic being.

> Something is therefore immediate, self-referring existence and at first it has
> a limit with respect to an other; limit is the non-being of the other, not of
> the something itself; in limit, something marks the boundary of its other
> (Hegel 2010, 98/21.114).

`Limit` establishes a relationship between `something` and `other`, but in such
a way that the `being-for-other` of the `other` has been negated by prefixing
`non-` to this being. The logic here is quite familiar; `limit` just posits the
"border" that acts as the threshold where what is outside `something` ceases to
be since it is precisely excluded.

But the same matter holds for the `something` vis-à-vis the `other`, namely,
that the `something` ceases at the point at which the `other` begins. Now, it is
important to keep in mind that this `other` is _also_ a `something` in its own
right, such that _it_ also excludes _its_ outward relation. As Hegel writes:
"The limit that something has with respect to an other is, therefore, also the
limit of the other as a something" (Hegel 2010, 98/21.114).

This then folds into the idea that `limit` does not merely exclude the
`non-being` of the `other`, since this `other` is also a `something`, what it
basically excludes is `something` as such. `Limit` is not then merely negating
the negative&mdash;the otherness of the thing or what the thing is
_not_&mdash;but things in general.

This has the implication that `something`, in _limiting_ `others` to preserve
_its own_ self-reference, in the same breath ends up limiting _itself_.

> In limiting, something is of course thereby reduced to being limited itself;
> but, as the ceasing of the other in it, its limit is at the same time itself
> only the being of the something; _this something is what it is by virtue of
> it_, has _its quality in it_ (Hegel 2010, 99/21.114).

Hegel elaborates that `limit` does double work: it not only negates the being of
the `other`, but gives `something` its being. In everyday situations, the things
one encounters are already limited, but that this limit belongs to the thing in
question. For example, my perception is limited, I cannot see what is behind
that hill, or this screen is limited. There are points at which the thing ceases
and goes no further, but this serves to define the thing, to give it its own
enclosure, as it were. And yet, it is these limits that put the thing in touch
with other things: the screen with the space around it; the "behind-the-hill"
forms the background of the "hill" that is foregrounded. In this way, `limit`
acts as a bridge that preserves the being of things, yet connects them to one
another. As Hegel confirms:

> Something, as an immediate existence, is therefore the limit with respect to
> another something; but it has this limit _in it_ and is something through the
> mediation of that limit, which is just as much its non-being. The limit is the
> mediation in virtue of which something and other each _both is and is not_
> (Hegel 2010, 98/21.114).

`Limit` mediates `something` and `other`, and it is through this mediation that
each of these categories become defined. In other words, a thing exists because
it is limited, which, likewise, brings an other into view. However, it precisely
for this reason that both also _cease to be_, since if `something` and `other`
are connected through the `limit`, then they are not really limited by it as it
first appears to be the case.

### Being Outside its Limit

Given that `limit` is that through which a thing and its outside both exist,
Hegel takes matter one step further and shows how a thing has its existence
_outside_ its limit.

> Now in so far as something in its limit both _is_ and _is not_, and these
> moments are an immediate, qualitative distinction, the non-existence and the
> existence of the something fall outside each other. Something has its
> existence _outside_ its limit (or, as representation would also have it,
> _inside_ it); in the same way the other, too, since it is something, has it
> outside it. The limit is the _middle point between_ the two at which they
> leave off. They have existence _beyond_ each other, _beyond their limit_; the
> limit, as the non-being of each, is the other of both.

If a thing is because of its limit, then it is what is beyond that limit which
actually serves to define what that thing is. It is in this sense that Hegel
means that `something` has its `existence` _outside_ its limit. This appears
like the ordinary notion of how things are limited in virtue of other things
outside them. For example, one's desire for power seems curtailed by the fact
that there are others who also desire the same, such that each externally limits
the other. But for Hegel, `limit` is not external to `something` but is that
through which it _is_; this means that it is not in fact others that limit one,
but that one limits oneself in the context with others. Indeed, to continue the
example: it is thanks to others that power becomes possible in the first place,
let alone desired, and what is this desire if not to test one's limits?

`Limit` is additionally regarded as the `non-being` of each `something` (in the
context of `something` and `other`), and in this respect the `limit` itself
forms a second `other` in the relation between two `somethings`. Not only is
another thing an `other` to this `something`, but the `limit` has a foreign
aspect to it since this `something` has its existence beyond it, or it _is_
already beyond it. The `limit` thereby is _not_ limiting; it is not securing the
`being` of `something` vis-à-vis its `non-being` or the `other`.

To rephrase: if limit makes the thing what it is because it negates the other
thing, it has already put that other thing in touch with this thing (negation
here not being elimination as much as it is a form of connection through the act
of defining or determining), and that in reality neither is fully limited by the
other, but that, rather, the limit itself appears as the real other with respect
to these things. Paradoxically, then, each thing is, precisely because of the
limit, beyond itself.
