**NOTE**: Incomplete material on appearances, we can circle back to this later
or deal with it at the level of essence.

Another thing to note is that the idea of `appearance` entails, or presupposes,
that which does _not_ appear. That is, given certain conditions under which
something does appear, it could be regarded in itself _apart_ from those
conditions.

Consider ALLISON 2004, 56, see also 53-4.

Houlgate writes that the thing in itself is a necessary correlate to the concept
of `appearance` or phenomenon, and quotes, from Kant, "the understanding, when
it calls an object in relation mere phenomenon, simultaneously makes for itself,
beyond this relation, another representation of an _object in itself_" (Kant
1998, 360/B306; Houlgate 2022, 32).
